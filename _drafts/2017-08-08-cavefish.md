How can a species of fish have some fish with eyes and some fish without them?  How did these fish get to be this way?  That’s what Reed Cartwright and his team in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University wanted to know about these fish called Mexican Tetras.

The Mexican Tetra, scientific name Astayanax mexicanus, is a freshwater fish that lives in creeks and rivers in southeast Texas and central and eastern Mexico.  There are two distinct populations in this species.  One lives at the surface and the other lives in dark caves.  Unlike their counterparts at the surface, the cave dwelling population is blind, ranging from degenerated sight to loss of sight to even the loss of the entire eye.  In addition to their loss of sight, cave swelling tetra populations also have no pigment.  Instead, they are a pink/white color resembling an albino.  The cave dwelling population were once thought to belong to separate species but sighted surface dwelling fish and blind cavefish can produce fertile offspring.

So what are some of these fish blind while other can see?  There are currently two hypotheses to explain it: the neutral mutation hypothesis and the adaption hypothesis.

The neutral mutation hypothesis states that a random change in the DNA, a mutation, of the genes that relate to sight would result in nonfunctioning genes and lead to blindness.  Because sight is not necessary to survival to the fish in the caves, fish with nonfunctioning eye genes can still survive and produce offspring, which have the same nonfunctioning eye genes.  Fish that had these mutations at the surface probably wouldn’t survive.  But mutations that cause blindness in the cave population would take a long time to make the entire population blind.  Genetic drift has been proposed to play a role.  Genetic drift is when one genotype becomes more frequent in a small population due to random chance.  Other genotypes in the same population becomes less frequent or even disappear.  In the case of the cavefish, a random mutation would appear that affects the sight of the fish and due to genetic drift, the fish in the cave population, over many generations, would gain this nonfunctioning eye genes.  

The adaptation hypothesis, on the other hand, is not due to random chance.  It suggests that there is a cost to having eyes, either from making a complex structure during development or because it is vulnerable to disease, attacks, etc.  When eyes are not helpful, such as in the dark caves, fish without eyes have a greater fitness.  They do not spend energy making a structure they may never use and they are not vulnerable later in life.  These fish are able to reproduce more than the sighted fish because of their fitness so there are more fish in future generations with nonfunctioning eyes in the caves.  However, if eyes are helpful, such as at the surface, fish with eyes would have the greater fitness and would reproduce more than the fish with nonfunctioning eyes.  It is by this way that nonfunctioning eyes are “chosen” for in the caves by a process called Selection.  

Dr. Cartwright and his colleagues created simulations to test which hypothesis best fit what was observed in the fish.  They used equations with variables including the amount of blindness in the populations, the fitness advantage of blindness in caves, the migration rate between the caves and the surface, and the size of the population.  What they found from the different models was that there must be a strong selective force to achieve blindness in the cave population.  This was consistent with the behavior that sighted fish migrate out of the caves, which leaves mostly blind fish, and that having eyes has a high energy cost.

All the data lead them to conclude that the adaptation hypothesis is more correct.  They proposed to expand the hypothesis to migration-selection, because it was the combination of the two and not adaptation alone that lead to the blindness in cavefish tetras.
