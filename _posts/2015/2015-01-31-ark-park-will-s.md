Wave 3, which appears to be Channel 3 in Louisville, Kentucky, [reported](http://www.wave3.com/story/27986922/ark-encounter-plans-to-sue-kentucky-over-tax-incentives) yesterday that the Ark Park indeed plans to [sue](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/12/ark-encounter-t.html) the state over tax incentives that were denied last month. Wave 3 reports, 

> Lawyers say this encounter is about to make an appearance in court and it's all over tax incentives. The lawyer for the Ark Encounter says it will sue the state in federal court to try to regain the rebates it believes the state should give it for building the biblical attraction.

The link is approximately a transcript of the Wave 3 television broadcast, but the broadcast itself is worth watching &ndash; the television reporters got a tour of the construction site, and it looks  like they are actually building the model Ark. A nice slideshow, [Constructing the Ark Park](http://www.wave3.com/link/730347/slideshow-constructing-the-ark-park), is also linked to the Wave 3 Web page.

The lawyer for the Ark Park, Mike Johnson, made an interesting statement:

> They had to move over a million cubic tons, I think it was, of dirt.

If that is true, then the ton must be a unit of length, or else they are building the model in a 9-dimensional space. Maybe that is how Noah snuck so many creatures onto the Ark: he dropped them off into some of the extra dimensions. Works as well as any explanation promulgated by AIG. I hope that Mr. Johnson is as good a lawyer as he is an engineer.
