I am sure we all read it in the papers several weeks ago: Two-thirds of all cancers are caused by bad luck. The _New York Times_ [said so](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/health/cancers-random-assault.html). _Science_ magazine, which published the [original article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6217/78.full) [said so](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6217/12.full) too. 

Only problem, the original article did not say that, and to her credit, Jennifer Couzin-Frankel, the _Science_ reporter who "said so too," corrected the record in a sort of [meditation](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/01/bad-luck-and-cancer-science-reporter-s-reflections-controversial-story) on the difficulty of getting difficult scientific concepts correct while working on deadline.

In fact, the authors did not say that "\[r\]andom mutations may account for two-thirds of the risk of getting many types of cancer, leaving the usual suspects&mdash;heredity and environmental factors&mdash;to account for only one-third, ..." as the _Times_ put it. What they said was more subtle, that two-thirds of the _difference_ in cancer _rates_ between different tissues could be explained by random bad luck. That is, "\[s\]ome tissues are overtaken by cancer more readily than others, and mutations accumulating in stem cells explained two-thirds of that variability," in Couzin-Frankel's words.

It is good to know that _Science_ is self-correcting.
