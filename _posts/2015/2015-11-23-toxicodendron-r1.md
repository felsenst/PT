<big>[_Toxicodendron ~~radicans~~ rydbergii_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicodendron_radicans) -- western poison ivy, South Boulder Creek Trail, Boulder, Colorado, July, 2015. As I was taking the picture, a little voice approached me and asked, "Do you know &mdash;? Is that &mdash;? Could that be &mdash;? Poison ivy?" Yes, and it was one of the lushest fields of poison ivy I have seen this side of New Jersey, growing right along the trail. You can identify it because it has 3 leaflets, and often the outer ones are shaped like mittens, though not as distinctively as these. Poison ivy is red only in the fall; we will see that in 2 weeks.</big>
