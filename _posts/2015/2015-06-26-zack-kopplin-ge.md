You can read it for yourself [here](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/bobby-jindal-zack-kopplin-evolution). But, for my money, Mr. Kopplin exposes Gov. Bobby Jindal's inner hypocrite with these too kind words:

> "I mean, who knows? I could be totally wrong, and maybe Jindal believes this \[creationism\] with his whole heart. Which is more why I go back to what his kids are learning. I had their seventh-grade biology teacher at \[University Laboratory School\] where I went for middle school, and I know she doesn't just _teach_ evolution--she's absolutely obsessive about it. If Jindal actually was a creationist, I think he'd have a much bigger problem with his kids being taught what evolution is."

Mr. Kopplin, who is on the verge of graduating from Rice University,

> has continued to beat the drum on what he views as the erosion of public schools. He has broadened his focus to include the governor's voucher program, which diverts state money to religious schools that question evolution and openly discriminate against students who violate their moral code. ... And Kopplin has expanded his push to Texas, where he discovered that students at the state's biggest charter school network were being taught that the "sketchy" fossil record undermines the theory of evolution.
