The tenth annual [Evolution Weekend](http://theclergyletterproject.org/rel_evolution_weekend_2015.html), February 13-15, is almost upon us. To check out what's going on in your neighborhood, click [here](http://darwinday.org/events/). This year's theme is Science and Religion in Dialogue: Past, Present, and Future. The Evolution Weekend website notes,


> Evolution Weekend is an opportunity for serious discussion and reflection on the relationship between religion and science. An ongoing goal has been to elevate the quality of the discussion on this critical topic, and to show that religion and science are not adversaries. Rather, they look at the natural world from quite different perspectives and ask, and answer, different questions.
> 
> Religious people from many diverse faith traditions and locations around the world understand that evolution is quite simply sound science; and for them, it does not in any way threaten, demean, or diminish their faith in God. In fact, for many, the wonders of science often enhance and deepen their awe and gratitude towards God. 


While I do not entirely agree with the sentiment expressed in the first paragraph, it is better than some of the alternatives.

Finally,  [NCSE](http://ncse.com/) reminds us that the anniversary of Darwin's birth is February 12, and House Resolution 67 would recognize


> Charles Darwin as a worthy symbol on which to
> focus and around which to build a global celebration of science and
> humanity intended to promote a common bond among all of Earth's
> peoples.


Rep. Jim Himes introduced the bill on February 2, and, according to a [press release](http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2015-01-congressional-resolution-introduced-to-support-darwi) from the American Humanist Association, it is the latest in a series of such resolutions, the previous four having been introduced by Rep. Rush Holt and Rep. Pete Stark. Although the PR is not explicit, I think we may infer that none has so far passed the House.
