The Washington Post [reported](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/justice-scalia-takes-on-commencement-cliches-in-humor-filled-speech/2015/06/04/a8c32f7e-0a27-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html) the other day that Justice Antonin Scalia, in a commencement address, said,


> Humanity has been around for at least some 5,000 years or so, and I doubt that the basic challenges as confronted are any worse now, or alas even much different, from what they ever were. 


I suppose that "_at least_ 5000 years" gives you some wiggle room, but I would hardly call, say, 200,000 years "at least 5000 years." That is a bit like saying, "The trip from Boulder to New York is at least 20 kilometers." 

Jerry Coyne, who is much nicer than I am, thinks that it might have been "[just an offhand remark that's been blown out of proportion](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/06/07/does-scalia-really-think-that-humanity-is-5000-years-old/)." Well, maybe, but I watched most of the speech on Professor Coyne's website, and I could not help but notice that Justice Scalia was reading that text: he did not misspeak.

Justice Scalia [dissented](http://www.belcherfoundation.org/edwards_v_aguillard_dissent.htm) in _Edwards vs. Aguillar_, but he seemed more concerned with whether the legislature _intended_ creation "science" as a religious doctrine than with its scientific merit. He also supported the "balanced treatment" argument to the effect that students who learn evolution are entitled to the opposing view as well. His argument was well reasoned but depended on the assumption that creation science is not a religious doctrine if its supporters think it is not.

Contrary to some reports, Justice Scalia did not say, "The body of scientific evidence supporting creation science is as strong as that supporting evolution"; rather, he was paraphrasing the testimony of witnesses and states explicitly "that I by no means intend to endorse its accuracy" but that "what is crucial is not \[the legislature's\] _wisdom_ in believing that \[a certain secular\] purpose would be achieved by the bill, but their _sincerity_ in believing it would be" \[italics in original\]. 

Still, Justice Scalia generally comes across as an authoritarian, uncomfortable with ambiguity and guided by literalist interpretations. If he takes the Bible as literally as he takes the Constitution, then it is easy to see that he might well believe in a young Earth. I hope I am wrong and Professor Coyne is right.
