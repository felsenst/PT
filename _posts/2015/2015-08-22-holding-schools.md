Simon Brown of Americans United [reports](https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-of-separation/scheduling-snafu-ky-lawmakers-want-to-extend-summer-vacation-so-kids-can) that 2 Kentucky lawmakers plan to introduce a bill that would prohibit local public schools from beginning the fall term before late August. The avowed purpose of the legislation is to support the Ark Park. One of the legislators, Damon Thayer, explained,


> Grant County is set to become a major tourist destination due to the presence of the Ark. But there won't be many families from Kentucky visiting in August if we continue with the current calendar


Mr. Brown points out in his article, however, that if the Ark Park will truly get 2 million visitors in its first year, the vast majority will not come from Grant County and thereabout. Local school officials [are not so keen on the idea](http://insiderlouisville.com/metro/education-community/education-leaders-push-back-proposal-mandate-later-start-date-kentucky-public-schools/) either.

In addition, and not entirely off topic, Dan Phelps notifies us of another editorial (available in hardcopy only) by Mark Looy of Answers in Genesis. Mr. Phelps writes that Mr. Looy


> will not admit that AIG's loss of the tax incentive is because of their discriminatory hiring practices. He ignores the advertisement for Computer Assisted Design technician from a year ago that got them in trouble. If you recall, the advertisement required adherence to AiG's statement of faith, salvation history, and membership in very specific types of Christian churches. Furthermore, when Ark Encounter originally received the tax incentive in 2010/2011 they specifically said they would not discriminate in hiring.

Ark Encounter is a for-profit corporation, and Mr. Looy knows perfectly well how to get his tax incentives restored; as I [noted recently](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/11/ham-handed-atta.html),


> _... Ark Encounter's tax incentives will be restored_, if only they pledge in writing that they will not discriminate in employment. Ark Encounter has so far declined to give such assurance, which makes a body speculate that they just might be thinking of laundering all Ark Encounter employment through Answers in Genesis in order to circumvent the law.
