[NCSE](http://ncse.com) tells us,


> April 18-25, 2015, is the inaugural [Climate Education Week](http://www.climateeducationweek.org/), sponsored by Earth Day Network. To celebrate, the Climate Education Week website is providing K-12 educators with the Climate Education Toolkit -- "a free, easy-to-use, ready-to-go resource with everything you need. The Toolkit includes a week's worth of lesson plans, activities, and contests for K-12 students that meet Next Generation Science Standards and Common Core. Each day covers a different theme related to climate change with two highlighted activities handpicked by Earth Day Network for your use." There are videos, contests, a downloadable Earth Day poster, and even an interactive on-line textbook for middle school students -- all aimed at helping to promote climate education!

You may find [NCSE's resources](http://ncse.com/climate) on climate science and climate education on their Website.
