A new PBS series, [Earth: A new wild](http://mashable.com/2015/01/21/new-show-panda-breeding-video/), will highlight China's breeding of giant pandas with the intention of introducing them into the wild. One goal of the series is to demonstrate that humans and nature are interdependent, according to its producer, M. Sanjayan. The 5-part  series will begin on February 4. You may see a 1.5-min clip from the show at the link above. You may also see photographs of newborn panda triplets [here](http://mashable.com/2014/08/12/newborn-panda-triplets/). 

There is no truth to the rumor that our colleague Professor Steve Steve sired any of the baby pandas.
