From William Dembski's **[new blog](https://billdembski.com/a-new-day/)**, for November 9<sup>th</sup>:

> In the last few years, my focus has switched from ID to education, specifically to advancing freedom through education via technology. All my old stuff on ID is on the present site (it was previously at DesignInference.com, which is no more), and can be accessed by clicking on "Design" in the main menu.
> 
> I still have a few ID projects in the works, notably second editions of some of my books (e.g., NO FREE LUNCH and THE DESIGN INFERENCE). I regard BEING AS COMMUNION: A METAPHYSICS OF INFORMATION (published 2014) as the best summation of my 23-years focused on ID (the start of that work being my article "Randomness by Design" in NOUS back in 1991).
> 
> I'm happy for the years I was able to spend working on ID, but it's time to move on. I'll be describing my new endeavors on this new blog.

Discuss.
