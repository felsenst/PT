It is 7 am in Australia, but this is finally out on Thursday afternoon in the U.S....just in time for the tenth anniversary of _Kitzmiller v. Dover_!  I will do a longer post a little later, but for now - be sure to check out the Supplemental Material!

Matzke, Nicholas J. (2015). "[The evolution of antievolution policies after _Kitzmiller v.

See also: [PDF of character maps for characters 1-111](/uploads/2015/charmaps_001-111_text_segment_presence_absence_cropped.pdf) of the Matzke (2015) phylogeny of antievolution bills. These are the presence-absence characters; there are more characters but in a larger file, we'll see how PT handles this one first
