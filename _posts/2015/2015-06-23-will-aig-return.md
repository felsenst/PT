Dan Phelps alerted us to the fact that AIG's _Allosaurus_ fossil had been donated by an organization headed by Michael Peroutka, a man affiliated with "a white supremacist, neo-Confederate and pro-secessionist organization that has been named a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center." Mr. Phelps now writes,


> Interesting that [this press release](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html) didn't get any coverage when I sent out the information last year. The Creation Museum received an _Allosaurus_ dinosaur fossil appraised at $1 million from a donor who was on the Board of Directors of the [League of the South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_the_South).
> Various politicians are returning donations from hate groups after the recent Charleston shooting. According to the [Encyclopedia of Modern American Extremists and Extremist Groups](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Modern-American-Extremists-Extremist/dp/0313315027) (by Steven E. Atkins, 2002, Greenwood Press), "Close ties have been formed between the LOS  \[League of the South\] and the Council of Conservative Citizens with a significant cross-membership" (p. 174). Horrifyingly, Dylann Roof [received some of his inspiration from the Council of Conservative Citizens](http://www.businessinsider.com/council-of-conservative-citizens-defends-dylann-roof-2015-6) \[a direct descendant of the White [Citizens' Councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Councils) that were established in the 1950's, primarily to oppose school integration\].

> Answers in Genesis (the owners of the Creation Museum) admirably makes anti-racist statements at times, but has taken a valuable donation from Michael Peroutka, a former Board Member of the racist hate group known as the League of the South. Why doesn't the Creation Museum return the fossil or give it to a real science museum?
