I do not know what to make of this, but [UPI reports](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/07/11/Earth-heading-for-mini-ice-age-in-just-15-years-scientists-say/2751436649025/) that a team from the University of Northumbria, "saying they understand solar cycles better than ever, predict that the sun's normal activity will decrease by 60 percent around 2030 &ndash; triggering the 'mini ice age' that could last for a decade." That sentence is unclear, but I presume they mean "normal _sunspot_ activity." As they do not quite say, the northern hemisphere (at least) experienced the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age) about 300 years ago. The Little Ice Age corresponded with a period of minimal sunspot activity known as the [Maunder minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum), and Wikipedia states that a causal connection has recently been established.

Nothing in this report contradicts conclusions about climate change and anthropogenic global warming. Nevertheless, expect climate-change deniers to have a field day!
