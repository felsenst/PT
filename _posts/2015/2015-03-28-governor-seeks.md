Tom Loftus reports in the Louisville Courier-Journal that Gov. Steve Beshear has [asked a federal court to dismiss](http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/27/beshear-asks-dismissal-ark-case/70571974/) the [Ark Park's lawsuit](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/01/ark-park-will-s.html) on the grounds that "\[p\]roviding the public funding sought for religious purposes ...would constitute an unlawful establishment of religion" and thereby violate both the state and federal constitutions. Governor Beshear and his co-plaintiff, state Treasurer Bob Stewart, told the Courier-Journal that "the state's denial of public funds for the ark park \[sic\] 'reflects no hostility toward Plaintiffs' faith' and does not prohibit Answers in Genesis and its affiliated organizations from following their religious beliefs." <br />

**Update, March 31, 2015**: Americans United for the Separation of Church and State has submitted a motion to intervene on behalf of four Kentucky taxpayers to "prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to unconstitutionally finance a religious ministry." According to a [press release](https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/americans-united-seeks-to-intervene-in-ark-park-tax-incentive-lawsuit), the taxpayers argue "that '\[t\]he tax rebates sought for Ark Encounter would effectively compel me, as a Kentucky taxpayer, to subsidize a religious ministry against my will.'" Two of the taxpayers are Christian ministers. AU has also submitted a proposed motion to dismiss, which I take it becomes active if the motion to intervene is granted.
