Last March Tom English and I posted an argument here
[here at Panda's Thumb](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/03/fitness-surface.html) analyzing 
[an argument by William Dembski, Winston Ewert, and Robert Marks](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0002).  They had made an argument that 
evolutionary "search" would not do better than blind search; we proved that their argument showed no such thing.

In response to
[our analysis here of the Dembski-Ewert-Marks paper](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/03/fitness-surface.html),
Winston Ewert 
[has replied](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2015/04/these_critics_o095561.html) at _Evolution News and Views_.  As that site does not allow comments,
I have finally gotten around to posting a response here (six months late).  Tom has now put up a [related thread at The Skeptical Zone](http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/the-law-of-conservation-of-information-is-defunct/); I will try to comment in both discussions.

Ewert rather dramatically reveals that Tom and I do not actually disagree
with any of the theorems in
their paper.  And he's right about that.  How did they discover
this remarkable fact?  Perhaps it was by reading our post, where we said

> We're not going to argue with the details of their mathematics, but instead
> concentrate on what in evolutionary biology corresponds to such a choice of a
> search.

or 
[by reading a comment in that thread](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/03/fitness-surface.html#comment-340053) where I also said:


> As theorems they may be mathematically true, but the average poor performance

> searches are included among the set of possible searches.

Ewert is right that we did not question their theorems. Instead we
concentrated on what would follow from their theorems.  We showed in a simple model  that once there are organisms that reproduce, with genotypes that have phenotypes and fitnesses, that evolution will find higher fitnesses much more effectively than random guessing.  So is it true that having what they call Active
Information, embodied in a fitness surface and in a reproducing organism
whose genotypes have those fitnesses, requires that there be
Design Intervention to set up that system?

The issue is not the correctness of their theorems but, given that they are
correct, what flows from them.  Dembski, Ewert, and Marks (DEM) may object that
they did not say anything about that in their paper.

We don't think that it is a stretch to say that DEM want their audience to
conclude that Design is needed.

Let's look at what conclusions Dembski, Ewert, and Marks draw from their theorems.
There is little or no discussion of this in their paper.
Are they trying to persuade us that a Designer has
"frontloaded" the
Universe with instructions to make our present forms of life?  Let's look
at what Dembski and Marks have said about that (below the fold) ...

Our analysis of what kinds of "searches" would be achieved by a reproducing organism that has fitnesses led us to this simple
conclusion 
[(summarized in a comment of mine in the thread following our post)](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/03/fitness-surface.html#comment-340026):

In short, with their theorems, Design is not needed to explain why a
reproducing organism whose genotypes have fitnesses might be able to
improve its fitnesses substantially.  Just having reproducing organisms,
and having the laws of physics, gets an evolving system much farther than a
random one of DEM's "searches".

But here's what William Dembski said about this in his
[interview at the Best Schools website:](http://www.thebestschools.org/features/william-dembski-interview/)

and here's what Robert Marks said [at his Evolutionary Informatics Lab website (http://evoinfo.org)](http://evoinfo.org) (copied 7 Nov 2015):

In case there is any doubt, here is what Marks said [in an "ID The Future" podcast](http://evoinfo.org) (This is available at
Marks's Evoinfo.org website, but for some reason not at the Discovery
Institute's "ID The Future" website).

Ewert himself, in his reply, uses the evolution of birds as an example:

This example leaves it unclear what the "process" is.  The reader may be 
tempted to conclude that it is the process that models an evolving
population.  And then the reader may think that if this evolutionary process
succeeds in improving fitness, that some outside force is needed to set
up the process so that it succeeds.  But for their theorem to apply, the 
processes considered must include processes that make no sense as models of
evolution.  Processes that wander around among genotypes randomly, without
being more likely to come up with higher fitnesses.  Even processes that
prefer to find genotypes with _lower_ fitnesses.   All of those are among
the processes that must be eliminated before we get to processes in which
genotypes have fitnesses, and those fitnesses affect the outcome of
evolution.  

But after narrowing the searches down to those that have organisms
with fitnesses, the probability of success is much improved.  And no designer
needs to intervene to get that improvement.

All that occurs even when the fitness surfaces are extremely rough, with
nearby genotypes having wildly different fitness.  But the laws of physics
strongly suggest that fitness surfaces will be much smoother than that.  That
smoothness is a further reason for evolutionary processes to succeed far
better than blind searches.

In his reply, Ewert invokes the smoothness of the fitness landscape, and considers the smoothness to result from "laws or self-organization"

> It is not sufficient to invoke the three-fold incantation of selection,
> replication, and mutation. You must also assume a suitable fitness landscape.
> You have to appeal to something beyond Darwinism, such as laws or
> self-organization, to account for a useful fitness landscape.

He does not seem to realize that those "laws" might simply be
the laws of physics, and that the "self-organization" can
simply be self-reproduction, something that all organisms do.

By simply declaring that we do not disagree with their mathematics, Ewert is
avoiding the issue of what flows from those theorems.  In their subsequent
statements, Dembski, Ewert, and Marks have made clear that they regard those
theorems as evidence for Design.  

It is clear from these examples that Dembski and Ewert mean their theorems
to be read as evidence for an Intelligent Designer either frontloading the
evolutionary process, or for an Intelligent Designer intervening in it.
But
Tom English and I have shown that their Active Information can come about
without that.  It can come about simply by having a reproducing organism which has different genotypes, which have different phenotypes, and these have different fitnesses.  And further Active Information can also come about by the predisposition of the laws of physics to bring about fitness surfaces smoother than "white noise" fitness surfaces. 

Could that Active Information be enough to explain the evolution of, say, a
bird?  Do they have some argument that further "configuration of a bird-making
process" is needed beyond that?  There is
actually nothing in their argument that
requires that there be further Intelligent Design.

This is bad news for the implications that they have drawn from their
theorems. 

To say that is to disagree fundamentally with Dembski, Ewert, and Marks,
however little we have questioned the validity of their theorems.
