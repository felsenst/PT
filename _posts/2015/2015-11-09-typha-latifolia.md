<big>[_Typha latifolia_](http://jeffco.us/coopext/plantdetail.do?sna=Typha+latifolia&amp;image=0) -- broad-leaved cattail, South Boulder Creek trail, 2015. The upper picture was taken with a Sony &alpha;6000 camera and a 310-mm (35-mm equivalent) lens; the lower with a Canon SX280 point-and-shoot camera and a 600-mm (equivalent) lens.  Consumer Reports rated the image quality of both cameras "Very Good," but they cautioned that you cannot compare ratings across camera types.</big>

<big>So I decided to compare the 2 cameras myself. The 2 images are cropped to show the same areas and reveal individual pixels.  The SX280 image shows some electronic noise and a bit of chromatic aberration.  The &alpha;6000 image, though taken at half the focal length, is far better. The &alpha;6000 may show better gray scale, but that may be an artifact of the exposure, which I have not compared.  Nevertheless, if you do not want to push the limit, the SX280 image is very serviceable indeed.</big>
