Spiderman Shpiderman &ndash; a penpal of mine, who can identify himself if he likes (I will of course understand if he demurs), asks,


> There's a lot of excitement and amazement about the lack of cratering and the height and sharpness of the geological features on Pluto. It appears that, contrary to earlier speculation, Pluto is geologically active and thus geologically young...though "young" in the sense that these features are probably less than 100 million years old.

> Now that the results are in, how long do you think it'll be until AIG posts something about how a "Young Pluto Supports Recent Creation" and "Secular scientists with atheistic uniformitarian assumptions predicted that Pluto would be a dead planet pockmarked by craters, but the evidence of recent geologic activity should come as no surprise to Christians, who know that Pluto was created along with all the other celestial bodies on the Fourth Day just over 6,000 years ago!"

The closest approach of the [New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons) spacecraft was last Tuesday, around noon UTC, and my penpal wrote, "I will give them until Friday morning." Friday has come and gone, and Saturday is nearly gone in Kentucky, but the latest post from AIG concerns the burning question of whether [ Spiderman really exists](https://answersingenesis.org/is-god-real/does-spider-man-really-exist/).

Perhaps the AIG-ites can use a little help. We invite our readers to suggest explanations (post hoc, of course, _and within a creationist framework_) for why Pluto and Charon are geologically active even though they are so small and so distant from the Sun.

We also suggest a Pluto Pool, wherein our readers try to guess the date and time of AIG's first comment on the fascinating geology of Pluto and Charon. The winner of the pool is the person who most closely predicts the correct date and time, but whose prediction predates that date and time. Entry into the pool costs nothing, and the winner receives a commensurate amount, because AIG's comment on the subject is bound to be worth that amount.
