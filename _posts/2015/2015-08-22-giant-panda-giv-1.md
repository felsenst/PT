Mei Xiang, a giant panda at the National Zoo in Washington, and a distant cousin of Prof. Steve Steve, [gave birth today](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/us/giant-panda-gives-birth-at-national-zoo-in-washington.html), only 3 days after she realized she was pregnant. The identity of the father is unclear, but Prof. Steve Steve asked us not to go into that.

Update, 9 a.m. August 23:  Prof. Steve Steve informs us that according to an updated Times  article (same URL), Mei Xiang has had twins.
