Professor Steve Steve informs us of an article [Why are pandas so lazy?](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/07/video-why-are-pandas-so-lazy) in _Science Now_. Professor Steve Steve takes exception to the claim that he is lazy. Yes, it is true that the giant panda's daily energy expenditure is about 5 MJ: roughly one-third that of a dog and about the same as a three-toed sloth. It is also true that Professor Steve Steve moves slowly and basks a lot in the sun. Why? Because the giant panda is a carnivore that survives on a low-energy plant diet, which his body is ill-equipped to digest. To conserve energy, he maintains a low body temperature, and his organs, including his brain, are small.

Professor Steve Steve demurs. He claims that he is not lazy; he is simply ruminating.
