Darrel Falk is co-president of the BioLogos Foundation and a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego.  He offers a calm review of _Signature in the Cell_ by Stephen Meyer, Director and Senior Fellow of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute (Disco).  _Signature in the Cell_ seems to be [Disco's main statement](http://signatureinthecell.eventbrite.com/) of late, but it fails to convince biologist Falk. 

Falk begins: 

> I believe there is a Mind who was before all things and through whom all things are held together (Colossians 1:17): I believe that Mind is the intelligence behind all that exists in the universe. Hence, I believe in intelligent design. Does that by definition then, place me in the Intelligent Design (ID) movement?

> No.
> 
> 
> The recent book, Signature in the Cell , by ID movement leader Stephen C. Meyer, illustrates why.

and ends:


> The science of origins is not the failure it is purported \[by Meyer\] to be. It is just science moving along as science does--one step at a time. Let it be.
