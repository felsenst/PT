According to an [article in Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/325/5941/664) this week, Microsoft has basically tried to patent phylogenetics, with their application, [Clustering Phylogenetics Variation Pattern](http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gHezAAAAEBAJ).  None of the broadly written claims in the patent application are novel, and most have been used by scientists for nearly two decades.  I think [Joe Felsenstein](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/felsenstein.html) should walk over to Redmond and hit them with a cluestick or at least throw [his book at them](http://www.sinauer.com/detail.php?id=1775).

Many systematics blogs have weighed in on this application: [Kevin Zelino](http://www.zelnio.org/2009/08/14/patenting-systematics-revisited/), [Dechronization](http://treethinkers.blogspot.com/2009/08/microsoft-patents-phylogenetic.html), [Myrmecos](http://myrmecos.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/will-microsoft-own-phylogenetics/), and [John Hawkes](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/patents/systematics-microsoft-patent-comparative-method-pennisi-2009.html), to name a few.
