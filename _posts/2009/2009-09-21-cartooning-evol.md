Mark Aldrich of Smith College has posted [a prodigious number of cartoons](http://sophia.smith.edu/~maldrich/evolution/home.html) under the title "Cartooning Evolution, 1861-1925." You may look at thumbnails listed under various categories: Darwin and
Evolution, Evolution as Social Comment, Victorian Science, and The Scopes Trial as interpreted by northern and southern newspapers and national magazines.  Each thumbnail has a link to a larger image.  According to Mr. Aldrich, many of the cartoons are readily available from the Library of Congress and other sources.
