Exactly one-hundred and fifty years ago, on November 24, 1859, _On the Origin of Species_ was published.  Ever since then, some have been [predicting the imminent demise of the theory of evolution](http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/demise.html).  But it's still here, and better than ever!  Let's make this an open thread, post links to the best _Origin_-related resources you've found, or whatever else you think is a milestone in the 150 years since 1859.

Here's mine: [The evolution of _The Origin of Species_.](http://benfry.com/traces/)  And take the [_National Geographic_ Darwin quiz](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/02/darwin-legacy/quiz-interactive).
