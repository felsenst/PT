I've received a letter from Iowa written by Dr. Hector Avalos, which, I think, may be of interest to many readers of this blog. In his letter Dr. Avalos reports about a defeat of ID advocates in one of the school boards in Iowa. The full text of Dr. Avalos's letter can be seen [here](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Iowa.cfm).  
I hope most of the PT's denizens will join me in expressing our gratitude to Dr. Avalos for his letter.
