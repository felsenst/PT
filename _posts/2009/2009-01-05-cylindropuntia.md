Update, 7 January 2009: Reader Stephen Early points out in a comment below that the cactus is in fact a teddy bear cholla, _C. bigelovii_, not a jumping cholla, _C. fulgida_.  I have changed the entry accordingly. By way of apology, all I can say is (a) I don't really know from cactuses, and (b) I thought our guide called it a jumping cholla. The Wikipedia entry for [jumping cholla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_cholla) notes that the term is often applied to chollas in general.
