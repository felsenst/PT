Following up on [the _Science_ story on the origin of adaptive immunity and the role it played in the Kitzmiller case](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/05/darwin-and-immu.html), [the _Science_ Origins blog has a short interview they did with me](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/05/nicholas-matzke-qa-from-chat-r.html) while writing the article.  It didn't make the final cut for the print version, but it is nifty for it to be [online](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/05/nicholas-matzke-qa-from-chat-r.html).  I hope I sufficiently acknowledged my PT collaborators and all the other friends/enemies on the net that made that particular bit of the Behe cross-examination seem like a good idea.

Also, while I am on this topic, I should mention that I have been invited to speak about the role of evolutionary science in the _Kitzmiller_ case, with special focus on the immune system science and how it was used in the Behe cross-examination.  This will occur on September 3, 2009 at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.  Here is the link for the meeting, September 2-4, 2009: [http://www.evolution2009.org/](http://www.evolution2009.org/).  [It looks like a fantastic lineup of speakers](http://www.evolution2009.org/program.htm).  The early (cheaper) registration deadline is July 31.  And yes, I am mentioned in the same sentence as another speaker, Jack friggin' Horner, which is just weird.  (PS: Email me if you'll be in the area and want to meet up!)

Here's the flier the organizer, Brad Ericson, sent me, and asked to have put up:
