Below are all our finalists in the "Minerals" section of our Photo Contest.  Please look through them one last time before voting for your favorite.  We know it is possible to game these polls.  Please act like adults and don't vote more than once.  If we believe that the results are invalid, the contest will be canceled.  The photos and poll are below the fold.
