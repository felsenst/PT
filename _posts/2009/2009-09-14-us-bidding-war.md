What a difference a week makes.

According the [Bay Area NBC website](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/movies/Creation-May-Cause-Big-Bang-in-US-59246832.html), there is now a "bidding war" for the US distribution rights for "[Creation](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/eugenie-scott-r.html)," the movie about Charles Darwin.  That's quite a difference from last week when it opened in theaters in the UK with little hope of finding a US distributor.
