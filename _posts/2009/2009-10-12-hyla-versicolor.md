If you can't see the frog, just go below the fold. <br />

Your irascible judges generally do not discuss their decisions, but we frankly ruled out this remarkable example of camouflage because, well, there is no picture there. 

My own pattern-recognition system is not so hot, and I simply could not find the frog until Mr. Garrison directed me to the photograph with the red outline. Once I identified the frog, however, I now see it immediately in the upper photograph. I have noticed the same phenomenon before, for example, in connection with photographs of the peppered moth -- once I finally identify the moth, I see it immediately the next time I see the same photograph. People in the audience when I gave a talk on the peppered moth told me they experienced the same phenomenon. Still, I am fortunate that I do not have to rely on frogs' legs for my sustenance.
