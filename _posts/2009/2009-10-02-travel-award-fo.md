NESCent has announced a travel award for an evolution blogger to attend ScienceOnline2010 (January 14--17th, 2010, in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park).  Bloggers should submit a blog post that highlights scientific results appearing in 2009,  dealing with current or emerging evolutionary research.  Posts should be 750--1500 words and must mention the contest.

For complete contest information, [visit NESCent](http://www.nescent.org/news/TravelAward.php).

If you submit something to this contest drop me a line as well, and I'll try to highlight your entry on PT as well.
