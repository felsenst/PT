Dr. Egnor has posted [ response to my comments about his blog posts.](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/03/mr_sandefur_wishes_to_exempt_h.html) He basically makes three points: first, he accuses me of misrepresenting him by calling him a creationist; second, he claims that it is constitutional for creationists to teach religion in government schools; third, he claims I am part of a conspiracy to preach atheism to schoolkids...or something. Let's see how much of this holds up.
