Literary agent Andy Ross was the owner of a bookstore in Berkeley that was bombed in 1989, apparently for carrying Salman Rushdie's _Satanic Verses_ after the fatwa was issued condemning Rushdie to death.  [Here](http://andyrossagency.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/remembering-the-rushdie-affair/) and [here](http://andyrossagency.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/rushdie-and-me-after-the-bombing/) are his memories of that day and its aftermath.  They are well worth reading and deserve wider circulation.  They remind us that those who would have us abandon reason on religious grounds do not always stop at words, and it is always worth opposing them.
