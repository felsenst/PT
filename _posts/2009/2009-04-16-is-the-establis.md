One of the central parts of [Michael Egnor's argument](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/04/why_is_censorship_of_scrutiny.html) (if such it can be called) for sneaking religion into science classes in violation of the First Amendment is to argue that restricting science classes to science is a form of censorship: that is, that the prohibition on putting a government imprimatur on a religious claim (_i.e._, Establishment Clause) is a violation of the principle of free speech.
