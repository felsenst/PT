# Future Evolution (SSE+SSB+ASN) Meetings:

2010 Portland, Oregon (Portland State University)

2011 Norman, Oklahoma (University of Oklahoma)

2012 Ottawa, Ontario 

# Future SMBE Meetings:

2010 Lyon, France

I wonder if the politicians in Oklahoma will try to ban the evolution meeting like they tried to ban Dawkins.  I bet you will see some bills trying to ban state funds for being used for the conference and others that demand an equally sized creationism conference.  Good luck with that.
