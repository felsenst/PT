Writing in <i>Christian Today</i>, Tony Campolo <a href="http://www.christiantoday.com/article/whats.wrong.with.darwinism/22647.htm">unloads the familiar creationist cliches</a> about what a big racist Charles Darwin was.

Campolo is something of a celebrity on the evangelical left, you might recall that he was a spiritual advisor to President Clinton, which makes this essay especially disappointing.  In the past I have tended to view him as an island of reason in what often seems like an ocean of evangelical narrow-mindedness.  To see him casually repeat a pile of hoary old smears and vile falsehoods about Darwin and his work is rather depressing, to put it mildly.

Anyway, I ponder the grim details <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/02/lunacy_from_campolo.php">over at EvolutionBlog.</a>  Comments may be left there.
