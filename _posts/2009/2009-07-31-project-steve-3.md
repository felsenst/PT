NCSE's [Project Steve](http://ncseweb.org/taking-action/project-steve), now with 1,097 signers, includes an array of notable scientists including the two eligible living Nobel Prize winners, Steven Chu (U.S. Secretary of Energy) and Steven Weinberg.  Another notable signer is Stephen Hawking, who holds the Lucasian Professorship in Mathematics at Cambridge University, the same professorship Isaac Newton held.  Yesterday [President Obama announced](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6734162.ece) that Hawking will be among 16 people to be awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, our highest civilian honor, joining (among others) Ted Kennedy, Desmond Tutu, and [Joe Medicine Crow](http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_911f356c-7d5f-11de-8132-001cc4c002e0.html), a tribal historian, author, and WWII veteran who won the Bronze Star.  We congratulate all the awardees, with a special congratulations to Hawking, Project Steve #300.
