We report (well really, [John Lynch](http://blog.jmlynch.org/2009/08/07/three-yec-amigos-join-the-biologic-institute/) and [John Pieret](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2009/08/pros-from-dover.html) report), you decide.

The [Biologic Institute](http://www.biologicinstitute.org/) is the research arm of the Disco 'Tute, promising (but not yet delivering) cutting edge intelligent design research.  Until now the Institute has been mainly the bailiwick of [Douglas Axe and a supporting cast](http://biologicinstitute.org/people/) of American ID proponents.  Now, however, [three new additions from overseas](http://biologicinstitute.org/2009/08/06/new-talent-from-new-places/#more-47) have been added to the Institute's roster.

What's delicious fun is that they're all Young Earth Creationists.

The question at issue is whether [Lynch's _Three Amigos_](http://blog.jmlynch.org/2009/08/07/three-yec-amigos-join-the-biologic-institute/) motif or [Pieret's _Three Stooges_](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2009/08/pros-from-dover.html) motif is most appropriate.  Cast your vote in the comments.
