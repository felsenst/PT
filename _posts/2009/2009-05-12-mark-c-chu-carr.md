William Dembski and Robert Marks have written a paper. No it won't be going in the peer reviewed literature, but into another of Dembski's anthologies. Mark C. Chu-Carroll of [Good Math, Bad Math](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/) explains what  is mind-bogglingly wrong with it [here](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/05/_so_william_dembski_the.php) and [here](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/05/dembski_responds.php).
