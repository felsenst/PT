Abstinence-only education is a failure.  Study after study has found that teenagers who receive abstinence-only education are no less likely to have sex as other teenagers, but are less likely to use protection when they do.

Now it appears that the prudes who brought us abstinence-only education in middle and high schools are targeting universities.  [According to the  Atlanta Journal and Constitution](http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/printedition/2009/02/08/legsex0208.html), several Georgia politicians and religious right activists have become upset that the University System of Georgia has faculty members who are experts in human sexual behavior and diseases.  These culture warriors are now making a bunch of noise to get the faculty members fired, while citing budget issues.  As expected, these politicians are ignorant of academia, public policy, public health, history, and the law.
