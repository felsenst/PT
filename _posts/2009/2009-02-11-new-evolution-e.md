The new issue of [Evolution: Education and Outreach is now online](http://www.springerlink.com/content/v6167602g164/?p=071f38dabe04459e8f12387817174cd3&amp;pi=0).  It is, of course, a 'Darwin' issue.  It includes [the late Michael Majerus'](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/majerus-tribute.html) final word on the pedagogical utility of _Biston betularia_, the peppered moth.  The papers are linked below the fold.  Links are to HTML versions; pdf versions are also available at the main site linked above.
