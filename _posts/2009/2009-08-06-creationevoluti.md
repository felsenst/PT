The NCSE started publishing a journal called _Creation/Evolution_ in 1980.  In 1996 it was merged with  _Reports of the National Center for Science Education_.  Now the entire run of _Creation/Evolution Journal_ [has been put online](http://ncseweb.org/media/cej).  It was OCRed so it's searchable, but it has not yet been proofread so searches may be a little wonky sometimes.
