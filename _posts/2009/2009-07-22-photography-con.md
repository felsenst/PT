This post announces the (first annual? Who knows?) Panda's Thumb photography contest. The winner will receive an autographed copy of 

[_Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)_](http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/Why_Evolution_Works.html), by Matt Young and Paul Strode.

The rules of the contest are simple:


1. We will consider any photograph that displays scientific interest but will give preference to biological, paleontological, geological, or cosmological interest.
1. Identify the subject of the photograph: common and biological name, mineral type, or geological formation, for example.
1. Submit photographs in JPEG format.
1. Reduce photographs to an information content of 600 pixels horizontally. If creationists require a definition of information, they may apply in writing to the management.
1. Photographs may be enhanced but may not be montages.
1. Submit a maximum of 3 photographs on or before August 8, 2009, to thousandwords@pandasthumb.org.
1. Depending on the number of photographs submitted, we may post the best submissions and ask our readers to vote for the best photograph.
1. By submitting a photograph, you stipulate that you are the owner of the copyright and grant The Panda's Thumb a nonexclusive license to publish the photograph on its blog.
1. Contributors to The Panda's Thumb are not eligible to enter the contest.
1. The decision of the judges is irrevocable.
1. The judges are irascible.
1. Since we have never done this before, we reserve the right to change any of the rules, or add or subtract rules at any time at our discretion.
