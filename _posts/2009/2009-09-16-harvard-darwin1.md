Sorry for the late notice, but there's a webcast tonight at 8:00 Eastern time from Harvard on "The World Before Darwin," by Everett Mendelsohn, a social historian of science.  A friend who was a teaching fellow for Mendelsohn tells me he's a very good speaker.  The webcast is free, but [you must register](http://darwinlecture1.eventbrite.com/).  When I registered a few minutes ago there were ~~599~~ 699 webcast 'tickets' left.

This is apparently the first in a series of talks in Harvard's "Darwin150" program celebrating the 150th anniversary of the publication of _OoS_.

_Hat tip to Patricia Princehouse, the former Harvard Teaching Fellow mentioned above._
