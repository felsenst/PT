Some of you might be familiar with the work of Walter ReMine. He's been around the fringes of the online creation-evolution thing for quite a while now. His typical schtick involves the relentless self-promotion of his [self-published](http://saintpaulscience.com/) book _The Biotic Message_, which he claims represents a revolutionary new origins theory of some sort.

It's been a while since [ReMine](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/how_fast_can_evolution_work.php) [was last](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/more_on_the_costs_of_evolution.php) [on my](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/more_on_evolutionary_speed_lim.php) [radar screen](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/basic_concepts_measuring_fitne.php), but he's posted [a couple](http://www.uncommondescent.com/education/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-part-1/) [of items](http://www.uncommondescent.com/philosophy/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-%E2%80%93-part-2/#more-6063) over at Uncommon Descent recently. These are advertised as the first two parts of a multiple-part essay of unspecified length. He promises that this essay will introduce readers to "Message Theory" - a term which he uses often, always with the capital letters, but has yet to actually define. Instead, he devoted all of his [first post](http://www.uncommondescent.com/education/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-part-1/) and [half the second](http://www.uncommondescent.com/philosophy/message-theory-%E2%80%93-a-testable-id-alternative-to-darwinism-%E2%80%93-part-2/#more-6063) to a discussion of the importance of testability, and why it's such a good thing that Message Theory is actually testable. (He does not, of course, explain how to test it in either post.) The remaining half-post is devoted to an explanation for why it's not possible for him to publish his idea in the form of scientific papers - apparently, it's too wide-ranging and comprehensive to fit in anything less than a book.
