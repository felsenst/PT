As some of you may be aware, over the last couple of weeks Timothy Sandefur and I had a debate on our blogs on the topic of government funding for scientific research. He argued against it; I argued for it. We wrapped up the debate yesterday. If you're interested in taking a look at the whole thing, you can follow the link at the bottom to find the links to the entire discussion (in chronological order).

I'm going to close the comments on this post purely for my own convenience. Comments remain open on all of the posts in the debate that are found at The Questionable Authority.
