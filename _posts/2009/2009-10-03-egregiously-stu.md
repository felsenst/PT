It was a tough call given [Casey Luskin's stupidity](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/10/key_bones_of_new_hominid_fossi.html#more) about _Ardipithecus_, but we have a winner.  In [an account](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/10/storming_the_beaches_of_norman.html) of Stephen Meyer's talk at the University of Oklahoma last week, Jonathan Wells wrote

> Furthermore, the similarity of HOX genes in so many animal phyla is actually a problem for neo-Darwinism: If evolutionary changes in body plans are due to changes in genes, and flies have HOX genes similar to those in a horse, why is a fly not a horse?
