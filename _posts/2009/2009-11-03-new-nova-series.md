First things first. The 3-part series is called [Becoming Human](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/beta/evolution/becoming-human-part-1.html), and it begins tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern time (and 7 p.m. my time, so check your local schedule).

The [website](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/beta/evolution/), which is in a beta edition right now, is called simply "Evolution." Today, it features articles on Becoming Human, Evo-Devo, and The Evolution of Motherhood, among others. It looks as though a regular feature will include links to recent news articles, and there are also links to apparently original material by Neil Shubin, Sean Carroll, and Carl Zimmer. There are additional links to a number of relevant books and websites. Finally, you can watch "Intelligent Design on Trial" and "Darwin's Darkest Hour" just by following links prominently displayed on the "Evolution" website.
