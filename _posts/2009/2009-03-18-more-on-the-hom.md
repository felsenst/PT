I [blogged the other day](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/judge-orders-ch.html) about a North Carolina judge's decision in a custody case. The case is being portrayed in the press as a religious conflict, in which the judge based his decision to deprive a mother of custody in part on the fact that she was teaching the children creationism. I suggested in my earlier post that the story sounded suspicious to me, largely because all we were given in the reports were quotes from the mother herself. We now have [a written decision from the judge](http://www.newsobserver.com/content/media/2009/3/17/courtorder.pdf) and it is clear that the original news story was, indeed, deeply misleading.
