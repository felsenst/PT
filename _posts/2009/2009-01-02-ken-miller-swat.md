For the three people who don't read [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/it_really_sucks_to_be_casey_lu.php), Ken Miller is [guest-blogging on Carl Zimmer's Loom](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/02/smoke-and-mirrors-whales-and-lampreys-a-guest-post-by-ken-miller/), swatting Casey Luskin's latest attempts to spin the _Kitzmiller_ trial testimony on irreducible complexity.

PZ feels _almost_ sorry for Luskin.  I don't: I saw him hovering outside the meeting room of the Ohio State Board of Education during our wars here.  No sympathy at all on my part.

Added in edit:  All three parts of Miller's smack-down of Luskin are up on The Loom now: [Part 1](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/02/smoke-and-mirrors-whales-and-lampreys-a-guest-post-by-ken-miller/), [Part 2](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/03/ken-millers-guest-post-part-two/), and [Part 3](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/04/ken-millers-final-guest-post-looking-forward/).  Part 3 is particularly interesting, with Miller looking at why Luskin is attempting to rehabilitate the ID position in the light of its epic failure in _Kitzmiller_.
