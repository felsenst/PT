[_Science_ Magazine](http://www.sciencemag.org/) is celebrating the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the sesquicentenary of his publication of _On the Origin of Species_ with the first of a monthly series of articles, beginning with an essay on the origin of life by Carl Zimmer.  This essay (and presumably the rest of the series) is available at no cost. A February issue will feature an essay on art. The latest issue (January 9) also features an article, "Darwin's Originality," by Peter J. Bowler, but that article is available only by subscription. Finally, _Science_ has initiated  _Origins_, their new evolution blog, which is available without subscription. You may get links to Zimmer's and Bowler's articles, and _Origins_ [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/darwin/).

**Update, January 15:**  Mike Klymkowsky of the University of Colorado has just notified me of a [special issue](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/specialissue) of _The Lancet_ devoted to "Darwin's Gifts." I got the entire issue [ here](http://mag.digitalpc.co.uk/fvx/lancet/darwinsgifts/), but I am on campus right now, so I do not know whether it is available free or whether I got it because our library has a subscription.  Maybe some reader can elaborate.  _The Lancet_ is a proprietary journal, and articles are generally expensive.
