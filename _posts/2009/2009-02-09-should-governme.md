Reed's recent post ~~urging support for~~ informing people about the "stimulus" bill has inspired a debate between me and Mike Dunford over the proper role of government in funding scientific research. Since _Panda's Thumb_is not a political blog, we'll be debating this at our own blogs. [My opening post is available this morning on _Freespace_.](http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2009/02/separating-science-and-state.html)
