I just received the following letter from Holland:

Yesterday 3 Feb, the Dutch evangelical, TV presentator and former 
director of the Evangelical Broadcast Organisation (EO),
Andries Knevel, openly rejected his belief in Young Earth Creationism 
and ID. He apologised for promoting those beliefs
in the past years to his children and the public. He wants 
credibility, reliability and belief. He desires an open debate about
God and evolution with believers and non-believers alike. He believes 
GOD and evolution do not exclude each other.
Both science and belief have their own value. He still belief that 
God created heaven and earth en that Jezus is our Saviour.

On July 27 2007 it was discovered and documented 
http://evolutie.blog.com/1962396/ that the EO censored all evolution
and old earth from the BBC documentaries of David Attenborough.
Now the EO no longer denies it was censorship indeed by showing 
fragments they censored in the past years.
This is a remarkable breakthrough and conversion. Especially hopeful 
in the Darwinyear 2009.
There are still YEC's in Holland, but the main evangelical television 
station has made a very promising move.
