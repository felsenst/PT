I was recently [interviewed](http://www.paw-talk.net/blog/19-general/1836-the-evolutionary-man-.html) by the blog [Paw-Talk](http://www.paw-talk.net/), as were [Evil Monkey](http://www.paw-talk.net/blog/19-general/1834-monkey-man.html) of the blog [Neurotopia](http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/) and [Bug Girl](http://www.paw-talk.net/blog/19-general/1830-a-bug-girls-life.html), of  [Bug Girl's Blog](http://membracid.wordpress.com/).  Paw-Talk seems to be a blog for pet owners or self-described animal lovers, but the proprietress (known to me only as Ava) says she wants to include more science articles and interviews with scientists. Aside from the somewhat corny introductions, I was impressed by the quality of Ava's questions, which clearly showed that she had done her homework before she requested the interviews. I did not notice any comments on the blog, but the Website also features a discussion board that looked well-attended.
