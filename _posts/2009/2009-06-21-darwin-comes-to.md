The Darwin exhibit organized by the American Museum of Natural History in collaboration with the Museum of Science, Boston; The Field Museum, Chicago; the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada; and the Natural History Museum, London, England that is currently touring North America will be at the [Great Lakes Science Center](http://www.glsc.org/darwin/) in Cleveland from June 27 through September 18, 2009.  From all reports this is a magnificent exhibition, well worth the drive to Cleveland.  In addition, several Cleveland institutions will have [related programs](http://www.glsc.org/darwin/darwin_programs.php) through the summer, including showings of [Galapagos](http://www.greatscience.com/visit/omnimax.php?id=38) at the Omnimax theater in the Science Center.
