There's more on the ICR's lawsuit against the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board over at [_Tony's Curricublog,_](http://curricublog.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/icr-2009-lawsuit/) and from Steven Schafersman of [Texas Citizens for Science.](http://www.texscience.org/releases/icr/ICR-lawsuit-analysis-2009April20.htm) Shafersman makes an important point here:

> ICR claims it "met or exceeded" the 21 Standards of Certificates of Authority. In fact, ICR did not meet several of those standards which was the basis of the THECB's refusal to grant the Certificate of Authority. Three of those unmet standards were faculty qualifications, the curriculum, and academic freedom of the faculty and students. The standard of judging these things is comparison with other Texas institutions of higher learning that offer the same Master of Science Degree in Science Education. ICR was in no way comparable to other institutions, which was the original THECB justification for denial of the certification. Indeed, ICR compares so unfavorably that in my opinion it would never be able to achieve accreditation from a legitimate accrediting association, and I believe ICR's plan was to keep renewing its state Certificate of Authority indefinitely (or seek legislative assistance in some fashion....)

> ICR's claim that it suffers from "anti-accommodational evolution-only-science enforcement policy practices" is frankly absurd. ICR has every right in the world to teach its Creationist pseudoscience to paying students and can continue to do that, so that falsifies its claim of illegal victimization by the State of Texas. It has no right, however, to demand that its graduating students be awarded a Texas-certified Master of Science degree, since under no definition of science or practice of legitimate science education in the United States is ICR's curriculum "science."
