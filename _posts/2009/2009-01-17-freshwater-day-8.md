I was unable to attend Day 13 of the hearing.  A water pipe froze overnight and I spent my day dealing with that.  However, two spectators at the hearing were kind enough to send me their notes on the day's testimony, and I've lightly edited them to produce this account.  In addition, there are stories in [Mt. Vernon News](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/01/17/top-story) and in the [Columbus Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/01/17/fresh17.ART_ART_01-17-09_B4_11CILOM.html?sid=101), both of which are quite detailed.

(I've done a little late editing to reflect feedback from one of the correspondents.)

More below the fold

This is the account sent to me by one observer.  It's in the form of a narrative.  It's lightly edited for formatting.

> Today started late but I am not sure why as both attorneys were present in the building at the expected 9:00 am start time although R. Kelly Hamilton was not in the hearing room until approx. 9:20 am.
> 
> Today's testimony began with Tammy Henry, 8th Grade Language Arts teacher who had worked in conjunction with John Freshwater.  Her initial testimony focused on student journals written in during bell time during the 2007/08 school year.   Although she could not produce these journals because they had been returned to students at the end of the school year, she expressed her belief that if there had been anything wrong or anything inappropriate done in Mr. Freshwater's class that the students would have told her about it by writing something in their journals about the incident.  She further testified that she was certain that if Zach Dennis had been burnt by the Tesla Coil that he would have definitely told her about it.   
> 
> During her testimony, Henry equated the use of the Tesla Coil in class to the electricity and electrostatic exhibits at COSI and didn't see how the Tesla Coil could cause harm if the COSI exhibits, which seemed to her to be exactly the same, did not.  
> 
> She testified that it was her belief that newspapers in general were the equivalent of National Enquirers and has informed her students that what is written in newspapers can't be believed. She stated that the newspapers printed lies and refuted the validity of a specific allegation toward Mr. Freshwater that had been discussed in the newspapers.  She surprisingly contradicted her statement that newspapers can't be believed in later testimony saying that she thought something that was printed in a particular newspaper article was actually an allegation of the lawsuit even though she had never read any part of the actual lawsuit that has been filed in Federal Court and had relied solely on the newspaper for that piece of information.
> 
> Her testimony was followed by a parade of teachers, guidance counselors and computer resource technician of the MV City Schools, including Brian Cook, 8th Grade American History; James Marth, Grade 4, Dan Emmett Elementary; Sara Malone, 7th Grade Social Studies; John Frye, MVHS Head Teacher, Dean of Students; Brian Gastin, MVHS English teacher; Ben Sanders,  MVMS Guidance Counselor; Steven Farmer, MVHS Science; Don Newcomer,  6th Grade Math; Ken Wiles, Computer Resource; Dave Carter, MVHS Guidance Counselor (H-O); Scott Dapprich, MVHS Physical Education/Health teacher.
> 
> In general, R. Kelly's questioning of these individuals was fairly repetitive with many or most being questioned regarding some of the following:
> 
> - Whether or not they had been interviewed by HR OnCall.  None had.
> 
> - Whether or not they had sons/daughters who had Mr. Freshwater for a teacher or FCA Advisor.  A number did in one or the other or both.
> 
> - Whether they had ever heard any complaints about Freshwater's class or teachings or acts while being an Advisor of FCA.  All testified that they had not heard any complaints.
> 
> - In reference to previous testimony by Chuck Adkins, did they feel they had a wide latitude in bringing in outside materials to teach from with specific questions regarding any movies that they allowed their students to watch during school time.  All the teachers, with the exception of John Frye, responded that they felt that they had wide latitude in bringing in outside materials as long as they pertained to the grade level benchmarks/indicators and as long as they were not controversial. John Frye felt that teachers did not have a wide latitude and felt that teachers should be more restricted to book and classroom materials. Mrs. Malone indicated that she had shown the movies, "Prince of Egypt," "Jason of (and the?) Argonauts" and "Obsession."  Mr. Farmer was questioned about his use of websites to create PowerPoint presentations in his classroom.
> 
> - Whether they had seen Mr. Freshwater ever reading his Bible or teaching from it or whether they had ever seen Mr. Freshwater teaching religion in his classroom.  All witnesses testified that they had not seen John read from or teach from the Bible and none had ever seen him teaching religion in the classroom, although none had actually sat through one of John Freshwater's classes.
> 
> - Whether they had seen any religious items (including Bibles) in any classrooms in the school district and who had those items in their classrooms or offices (including specific reference to the Bush/Colin Powell poster with Biblical Verse at the top).  The following names of teachers were brought up as having Bibles on their desks: Lori Miller, Brian Gastin, and John Freshwater.  It was also reported that Hayes Dean had Bible verses on the pictures of his kids, Carter had a Bush/Colin Powell poster and a teacher with the last name of Smith had a Bible verse. 
> 
> - Whether they had actually had religious items of their own in their classroom.  Gastin testified to having a Bible on his desk and a plaque of Jesus "at the door" beneath his desk as well as a Colin Powell poster which he had removed a week or so ago; Sanders testified to having a cross figurine in his office as well as the Colin Powell poster on the back of his door; Dapprich testified that he had a Bible and two Bible verses in his office. 
> 
> - Whether or not they, themselves, had used the Tesla coil in their classroom.  Farmer and Newcomer testified that they used the Tesla coil in class.
> 
> - Whether they had any training regarding the religion policy of the district.  All witnesses testified that they had not received any specific training regarding this policy.
> \*
> - Were asked to clarify whether they had to turn in lesson plans for the 2007/08 school year and whether they turned in lesson plans this school year.  This was asked of the Middle School teachers only. All said that during the 2007/08 school year that they turned in lesson plans for only a short time (i.e. several weeks) and are required to turn in lesson plans this year.
> 
> - Were asked if they were able to teach beyond the Academic Standards for their grade level benchmarks and indicators.  
> 
> Of more specific significance in these testimonies were:
> 
> 1.  Mrs. Malone's admission that she, herself, had volunteered to touch the arc of the Tesla Coil
> 
> 2.  Mr. Marth's presentation of a poster with the Ten Indian Commandments which had been subpoenaed for the hearing.  He described the poster as being more philosophical than religious from his viewpoint.
> 
> There was specific discussion concerning an inscription written by Tim Keib, previous acting Principal, on the back of Mr. Sanders' Colin Powell poster which read, "Thank you for ministering to MVMS students.  You'll never know how much I needed you this year."  Mr. Sanders testified that the year that Mrs. McDaniels left the district and Mr. Keib had to take over as interim principal had been a difficult year for both him and Mr. Keib.  The inscription had been written by Mr. Keib at the end of the year and it was at that time that Sanders received this poster.
> 
> Mr. Wiles testified that Mr. Freshwater had asked him in 2006 to help him determine which website one of his handouts had come from.  Mr. Wiles was never able to find the entire worksheet on any one website but found parts of what was on the worksheet given to him on two different websites, one was allaboutGod.com and the other one, I believe, is allaboutscience.com.

The second observer who helped me sent notes as they were typed up in a word processor from the handwritten notes taken in the hearing.  I'm reproducing them here as they were sent to me, since they're remarkably detailed.  I did a little fooling around with the formatting to make subdivisions clearer though the outline indents of the original did not survive the move to Movable Type, and removed a few personal remarks, but that's it.  This writer often uses the initial "F" for Mr. Freshwater.  MVCS means Mt. Vernon City Schools.

One of my correspondents also added this note:

> Almost every witness today either shook John's hand as they were leaving (even the Dispatch noticed this) or winked at Rep. Collier as they were leaving the testimony.  I was sitting \[near\] Collier and it was evident they were doing this.  You couldn't miss the wink!

"Colllier" is Thom Collier, a former conservative state representative from the local Ohio House district who was recently term-limited out of office.  He has been present for (nearly? - I'm not sure if he missed a day or two) all the hearing, and is listed as one of Freshwater's supporters on the [Bible on the Desk site](http://www.bibleonthedesk.com/communitycouncil.php), the so-called "Council for Free Expression."

To round out the coverage I'll quote a segment of the [Mt. Vernon News story](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/01/17/top-story) to give you another view of one witness' testimony:

> Tammy Henry, an eighth-grade English teacher on Freshwater's teaching team, said she had students make daily entries in their journals about each class they had the previous day. Henry said none of those entries contained any complaints about Freshwater or comments on discussions in his class about religion, intelligent design or creationism. She said she was confident that students felt comfortable enough with her to write of concerns they might have had, because, she said, "They'd talk to me about Freshwater, who was very popular with them, and also wrote about it \[Freshwater's class\]."
> 
> Henry told Freshwater's attorney, Kelly Hamilton, that she was upset that no one on Freshwater's teaching team had been interviewed by the investigators with HR on Call, and was "disappointed" that no one talked to her about allegations published in the News. She expressed shock at what was printed.
> 
> Henry said she was very suspicious about the investigator because the team worked closely with Freshwater and saw his worksheets, lesson plans and other instructional materials, and team members were not interviewed. In Henry's opinion, the investigation was "an inquisition."
> 
> "A subjective, one-sided investigation. ... They had a goal in mind," she said.

And about the same witness from the [Columbus Dispatch story](http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/01/17/fresh17.ART_ART_01-17-09_B4_11CILOM.html?sid=101):

> Students never complained about eighth-grade science teacher John Freshwater or what he was teaching, several Mount Vernon Middle School teachers testified today.
> 
> The teachers said they also heard no complaints from Zachary Dennis, whose parents have sued the district and Freshwater. The family says Freshwater burned a cross shape on the boy's forearm last year with an electrical instrument used to test gases in a laboratory.
> 
> The school board has said it intends to fire Freshwater. But state law gives the teacher a hearing before that can happen. Today's testimony came from teachers called by Freshwater's attorney. Each shook Freshwater's hand as he or she left the hearing.
> 
> Each of the 12 teachers and staff members also testified that the district gave them no instruction on school policies about teaching religious or controversial subjects.
> 
> Tammy Henry, an English teacher since 2001, encouraged her students to write personal observations in a diary they were required to keep in her eighth-grade English class.
> 
> The students described difficult teachers, personal problems and classroom politics. But last year, none ever mentioned Freshwater.
> 
> "It really shocked me," Henry said. "They would discuss other things with me."
> 
> After hearing accounts of the accusations against Freshwater, Henry e-mailed her principal, Bill White, and Freshwater's attorney, R. Kelly Hamilton, in July.

I'm vividly reminded of the stress in the community that Lauri Lebo described in [The Devil in Dover](http://www.laurilebo.com/dp/).  These are potentially destructive issues both for public education and for the larger community.

The hearing is now in recess until February 20.  There are three days scheduled in February and three in late March.  I thank both of my correspondents, and the checks are in the mail!
