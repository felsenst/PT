I got this announcement from AAAS today:

> The Obama Administration is seeking public input on policies concerning access to
> publicly-funded research results, such as those that appear in academic and scholarly journal articles. Currently, the National Institutes of Health require that research funded by its grants be made available to the public online at no charge within 12 months of publication. The Administration is seeking views as to whether this policy should be extended to other science agencies and, if so, how it should be implemented.
> 
> The Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President and the White House Open Government Initiative are launching a "Public Access Policy Forum" to invite public participation in thinking through what the Federal government's policy should be with regard to public access to published federally-funded research results.
> 
> To that end, OSTP will conduct an interactive, online discussion beginning Thursday, December 10. The discussion will focus on three major areas of interest:
> 
> \* Implementation (Dec. 10 to 20): Which Federal agencies are good candidates to adopt Public Access policies? What variables (field of science, proportion of research funded by public or private entities, etc.) should affect how public access is implemented at various agencies, including the maximum length of time between publication and public release?

Tips on how to comment and moderate posts are listed in the right-hand column.
> \* Features and Technology (Dec. 21 to Dec 31): In what format should the data be submitted in order to make it easy to search and retrieve information, and to make it easy for others to link to it? Are there existing digital standards for archiving and interoperability to maximize public benefit? How are these anticipated to change?
> 
> \* Management (Jan. 1 to Jan. 7): What are the best mechanisms to ensure compliance? What would be the best metrics of success? What are the best examples of usability in the private sector (both domestic and international)? Should those who access papers be given the opportunity to comment or provide feedback?
> 
> Each of these topics will form the basis of a blog posting that will appear at www.whitehouse.gov/open and will be open for comment on the [OSTP blog](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=3273.376350.654.65yGZX92NJ9llqsQEtdEpfQ..A) at blog.ostp.gov.
