To add to the various accounts of tours of Ken Ham's creationism museum, [Rationality Now](http://www.rationalitynow.com) has an excellent series of six posts [starting here](http://www.rationalitynow.com/blog/2009/09/02/creation-museum-part-1/)  The posts are particularly noteworthy for the excellent photographs, and I commend them to your attention.  The last two paragraphs of the last post are quoteworthy.  Referring to children with their families he saw in the museum, Dan writes:

> Some of those kids will be stuck in that world for their entire lives. They'll be raised that way and protected from any alternate viewpoints or ideas. They'll be shuttered away from any kind of real, intellectually challenging science. They'll be constantly given misleading or incorrect information about our world. Their parents will steep them in dogma, ritual, and ancient scripture for as long as they can manage... and the Creation Museum will be right there to back them up with pretty lights, bells, and whistles.
> 
> The museum is loathsome and its creators should be very, very ashamed.

But they aren't, of course.
