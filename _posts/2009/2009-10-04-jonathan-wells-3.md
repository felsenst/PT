Intelligent design creationists love to [talk about information theory](http://recursed.blogspot.com/2006/03/nancy-pearcey-creationists-miss.html), but unfortunately they rarely understand it.  Jonathan Wells is the latest ID creationist to demonstrate this.

In a [recent post at "Evolution News & Views"](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/10/storming_the_beaches_of_norman.html) describing an event at the University of Oklahoma, Wells said, "I replied that duplicating a gene doesn't increase information content any more than photocopying a paper increases its information content."

Wells is wrong.  I frequently give this as an exercise in my classes at the University of Waterloo:  _Prove that if x is a string of symbols, then the Kolmogorov information in xx is greater than that in x for infinitely many strings x_.  Most of my students can do this one, but it looks like information expert Jonathan Wells can't.

[Like many incompetent people](http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf), Wells is blissfully unaware of his incompetence.  He closes by saying, "Despite all their taxpayer-funded professors and museum exhibits, despite all their threats to dismantle us and expose us as retards, the Darwinists lost."  

We don't have to "expose" the intelligent design creationists as buffoons; they do it themselves whenever they open their mouths.
