I won't have a writeup of the Dec 8 tonight or even very soon.  Power was out this evening due to a windstorm, and the contractors came today to work on the house.  Pam Schehl has a [good summary](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/12/09/freshwaters-science-classroom-revisited) in the Mt. Vernon News.
