<p class="lead">Get out and celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of one of the most important scientists of all time, Charles Darwin, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of one of the most important books in biology, <i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i>. It's that day!</p>

<p>I'm in Minnesota, and you have a couple of options here. The Bell Museum in Minneapolis is having a party!</p>

<blockquote><p>Darwin Day Party<br />
Thursday, February 12, 2009, 7 to 9 p.m.<br />
Bell Museum Auditorium<br />
$10/ free to museum members and University students</p>

<p>The speakers will present in the auditorium from 7 to 8 pm. Birthday cake and refreshments are served after the presentations.</p>

<p>Celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birthday! Part of a world wide celebration, the Twin Cities' version is at The Bell Museum of Natural History this Thursday night. Join in the fun with cake, drinks and presentations by U of M scientists and educators. They will present funny, outrageous and controversial rapid-fire, media-rich presentations about Darwin and evolution. From the big bang to the human genome, hear the newest research and controversy on evolution and Darwin. </p></blockquote>

<p>I'm rather far from Minneapolis, unfortunately &mdash; if you live in the west central part of the state, or the eastern part of the Dakotas, we're having an open lecture here at the University of Minnesota Morris. Nic McPhee of the computer science discipline and PZ Myers of biology will be talking about "Paths to Complexity: How Biology and Computation can Build Intricate Processes and Systems" &mdash; it's a kind of anti-intelligent-design talk that focuses on the amazing stuff we do know about how chance and selection can build complex systems and efficient solutions.</p>

<p>We'll be on the UMM campus in HFA 6, at 5pm this evening. No charge, but come early &mdash; we expect to fill the joint up. If you can't make it, it is going to be recorded and a podcast made available later.</p>
