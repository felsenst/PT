I probably made my first purchase from [Edmund Scientific](http://scientificsonline.com/default.asp) in 1956, when they sold a lot of military surplus optics. Since then, they have grown into a fairly respectable supplier of scientific instruments to both professionals and hobbyists. I was dismayed, therefore, to learn yesterday that they also sell _pseudo_scientific instruments:

[Remote Viewing DVD](http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp?pn=3151874&amp;cmss=H31518-74&amp;bhcd2=1250900090). Remote viewing is described as "similar to clairvoyance or ESP."

[EMF Ghost Meter](http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp_Q_pn_E_3151281) for detecting "paranormal presences."

[3-in-1 Paranormal Research Instrument](http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp?pn=3151280&amp;cmss=H31512-80) for hunting ghosts.

This is appallingly bad stuff, but especially so for a scientific supplier. It is as bad as lying to people about evolution.  Edmund's allows comments, and if you wanted to let them know of your opinion, I would not try to stop you.

Acknowledgment. Thanks to Glenn Branch for the tip.
