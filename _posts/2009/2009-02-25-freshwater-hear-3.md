We've received emails wondering what's going on in the administrative hearing on John Freshwater's termination.  It was due to resume Friday of last week but that session was canceled at the last minute, apparently because of schedule conflicts among the attorneys.  It is now scheduled to resume tomorrow morning, Feb 26, and as far as I know -- and I've talked this afternoon with people who should know -- that's still on.

**Late Update**  Just got a call at 5:00 pm.  The referee has canceled tomorrow's session for some reason, but Friday is still (allegedly) on.
