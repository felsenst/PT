Michael Egnor's [most recent post](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/04/censorship_in_freespace.html) accuses me of being an "atheist fundamentalist" due to my belief that military chaplains are a violation of the Establishment Clause. Okay--call me what names you like. While I admit that my position is "extreme," whatever [that term might mean](http://www.newclarion.com/2009/04/the-extremist-smear/) in this context, it is one I am proud to share with James Madison, the author of the First Amendment, [who said,](http://www.constitution.org/jm/18191213_monopolies.htm)
