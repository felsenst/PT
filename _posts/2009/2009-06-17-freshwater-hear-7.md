John Freshwater's termination hearing was scheduled to resume tomorrow, June 18, but it has been postponed.  Two Board of Education members, Ian Watson and Jody Goetzman, were subpoenaed by R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater's attorney, but have refused to testify on the ground that if they testify in the hearing they'd have to recuse themselves from voting on the recommendation of the hearing referee.  Hamilton has asked the Common Pleas Court in Knox County to compel their testimony and the judge has not yet ruled on that request.  

I am reminded of James Hutton's 1788 remark on the age of the earth:

> The result, therefore, of our present enquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning - no prospect of an end.

And yes, I still have those 50 pages of notes on the two days in May in my backpack.
