As everyone in the science blogosphere knows by now, banana man Ray Comfort, he who cannot understand sex, is planning to distribute on the order of 170,000 (his claim) copies of Darwin's _On the Origin of Species_ in late November on various U.S. and Canadian university campuses.  The book is prefaced by [an introduction](http://assets.livingwaters.com/pdf/OriginofSpecies.pdf) (2 Meg PDF) by Ray that contains the standard creationist argle bargle.  

NCSE has created a page in response called [Don't Diss Darwin](http://ncse.com/dont-diss-darwin) that has a variety of resources and suggestions.  It has an appropriate flier, posters, and a lovely banana bookmark ready for downloading.

Most important for our immediate purposes, it contains a list of universities currently targeted.  That list is reproduced below the fold.  (I note that Lehigh is on the list; I wonder if Michael Behe will avail himself of the opportunity to learn some evolution.)

I urge scientists and interested folks on the infected campuses to seek immunization from the NCSE page.
