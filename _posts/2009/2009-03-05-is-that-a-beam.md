With the possible exception of Casey Luskin, no Discovery Institute fellow seems more eager to embarrass himself in public than Michael Egnor. [Dr. Egnor's recent "open letter" to the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/03/an_open_letter_to_the_society_2.html) attacked the Society for deciding not to hold its 2011 conference in New Orleans to protest that state's enactment of legislation designed to promote the teaching of creationism in government-sponsored schools. Egnor objected that the Society is acting unethically because "_most_ Americans are creationists," and for the Society to take a stand against creationism is a "demand for censorship." Worse yet, their decision is a slap in the face of American taxpayers whose tax money funds so much scientific research. It's hypocritical, he says, for scientists to take government funding while opposing the teaching of "creationism" (his word) in government schools. PZ Myers [responded to this at his blog,](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/michael_egnor_pounds_his_shoe.php) and now Egnor has [posted a reaction](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/03/pz_myers_americans_are_an_igno.html) at the DI's blog.

There are two points here that really must be made.
