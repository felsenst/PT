While Michael Egnor is [accusing the scientific community of censorship,](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/04/why_is_censorship_of_scrutiny.html) the Institut Discotheque is [advertising](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/04/deadline_nears_for_summer_semi.html) a summer seminar on Intelligent Design, and there's something very interesting about the advertisement. Applicants for the seminar are required to provide various information about their grades and their interests, [as well as](http://www.discovery.org/csc/events/2008.07.11/) "a letter of recommendation from a professor who knows your work **and is friendly toward ID,**or a phone interview with Dr. Bruce Gordon, CSC Research Director." Now _that's_ interesting--a letter from someone who is "friendly toward ID"? What is this if not a litmus test--a gatekeeper device to prevent critics or doubters from attending their seminar?
