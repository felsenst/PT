My response to [Tim Sandefur's opening entry](http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2009/02/separating-science-and-state.html) in our discussion of the pros and cons of government funding for basic science research is [now available At The Questionable Authority](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/why_its_good_for_us_to_fund_sc.php). In addition, he's posted a response to some of the comments on his original post that were left [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/should-governme.html) and at [my blog](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/should_the_state_pay_for_scien.php) in [a separate post at his blog](http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2009/02/comments-on-my-argument-regarding-science-funding--i-got-a-few-interesting-and-thoughtful-comments-about-my-post-regarding-go.html). 

In the interests of sanity - my own- I'm going to close the comments on this post. If you want to comment, please do so at my blog. (This way, I only have to try to keep up with one comment thread.)
