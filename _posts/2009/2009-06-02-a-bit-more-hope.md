As you may recall, the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), which recently moved from California to Texas, has [brought suit](http://www.texscience.org/releases/icr/ICR-lawsuit-analysis-2009April20.htm) against the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for the latter's denial of ICR's application for certification to award a Master of Science Education degree.  (In addition to the Texas Citizens for Science analysis linked above also [see here](http://curricublog.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/icr-2009-lawsuit/) for another masterly takedown of that suit.)  

What was less publicized was a bill in the Texas State Legislature to pull an end run around the Coordinating Board by exempting ICR's graduate program from the regulations governing degree-granting institutions in Texas.  

Another bill introduced in this legislative session would have restored the ID creationist "strengths and weaknesses" language to the Texas Science Standards.

Both bills have now died due to the adjournment of the Texas legislature.  So there's a bit more hope for Texas: Don McLeroy is out as Chairman of the State Board of Education, the creationist "strengths and weaknesses" language is not in the standards, and the ICR is still not certified to award phony graduate degrees in science education.

On the other hand, there's talk of a special session to straighten out some budget matters in Texas, so it's always possible that one or the other bill will come up again soon.
