The administrative hearing on the termination of John Freshwater as an 8th grade science teacher in the Mt. Vernon (Ohio) School District resumed yesterday after a 5 month hiatus.  I missed most of yesterday due to a doctor's appointment, but a friend took notes and will write them up for me sometime soon.  I attended the session today (Thursday) and another is scheduled for tomorrow.  I'll likely post an omnibus account over the weekend.  Meanwhile, there are news accounts [here](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/10/29/daubenmire-testifies-at-freshwater-hearing), [here](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/10/29/freshwater-morning-update-2), and [here](http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/10/29/fresh29.ART_ART_10-29-09_B3_8UFGQMC.html?sid=101).
