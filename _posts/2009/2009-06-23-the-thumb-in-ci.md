This week is the ninth quadrennial meeting of the [North American Paleontological Convention](http://www.napc2009.org) in Cincinnati, and Thursday the 25th is "Evolution and Society" day.  There are plenary talks in the morning by several people including Genie Scott and Ken Miller, and several parallel discussion panels around noon.  One of the discussion panels is "Countering Creationism" with Jason Rosenhouse, Art Hunt, me, and Professor Steve Steve from the Thumb all free associating to the topic title.  If you're at the convention we invite you to participate: we need all the help we can get!  Public school educators in the area have been specially invited to the day's talks and discussions, and we  enthusiastically welcome them.
