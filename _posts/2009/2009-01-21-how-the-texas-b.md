**By Josh Rosenau**

In November, the Texas Board of Education met to consider their new science standards. As I've mentioned a major point of contention is a reference in the current standards to "strengths and weaknesses" of scientific explanations, a concept only ever applied to evolution, and without any clear explanation of what it means.

In the course of [6 hours of testimony](http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/live-blogging-from-the-sboe-science-hearing-part-v), witnesses constantly asked what these "weaknesses" were, and got no clarity. Finally, at an ungodly hour, Cynthia Dunbar (the one [who thinks public schools are evil](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6148239.html) and that [President Obama](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6092712.html) is a s3kr1t Mussulman) gave her explanation. In the course of doing so, she perpetuated blatant falsehoods about a Nobel Prize-winning doctor.
