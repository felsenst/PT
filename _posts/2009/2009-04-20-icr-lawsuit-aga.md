The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) has [filed a lawsuit](http://ncseweb.org/creationism/legal/institute-creation-research-graduate-school-v-paredes-et-al) against the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) for denying it authority to issue masters degrees in science education. The ICR, of course, is a young earth creationist outfit that recently moved to Texas from California. It's been running [what it calls a graduate school](http://www.icr.org/icrgs/) for several years, issuing worthless pieces of paper that it calls advanced degrees in various sciences. Sadly, the ICR's "graduate school" was _officially accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation agency_--[something I consider something of a scandal.](http://web.archive.org/web/20031205173958/http://www.nexusjournal.org/2002judicial/dinosaurtracsRTP.htm) But when ICR moved, it [withdrew from that national accreditation](http://www.tracs.org/files/DOE_Nov07.pdf) because it expected that it would get accreditation from the state of Texas. That turned out not to happen: THECB unanimously denied ICR's request for authority to grant degrees purporting to be scientific degrees.
