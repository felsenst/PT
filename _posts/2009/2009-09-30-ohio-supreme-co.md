The Ohio Supreme Court today denied John Freshwater's motion for a writ of mandamus to compel Board of Education members to testify at the administrative hearing on his termination.  The [Court web site](http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/Clerk/ecms/resultsbycasenumber.asp?type=3&amp;year=2009&amp;number=1408&amp;myPage=searchbypartyname.asp) says only 

> 09/30/09   	 DECISION: Upon consideration pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5), cause ~~(sic)~~ dismissed

According to a [news report](http://www.knoxpages.com/?NewsID=7474&amp;CatID=1) (see also [here](http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/09/30/freshruling.html?sid=101)) the justices voted 7-0 to deny the motion.  Since it is a procedural issue, the Court will not elaborate in an opinion.

No word yet on what effect that will have on the course of the hearing.
