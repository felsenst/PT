They and we are both [mammals,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_mammals) but bunnies are in the order [Lagomorpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagomorpha) and we aren't.  Clarifying the relationships of the [mammalian orders (pdf)](http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/courses/3770darmstrong/Extended%20Order%20Guide_small.pdf) will require more data.  Unlike birds and lizards bunnies are [synapsids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsids).  Recall that early amniotes split into synapsids and [sauropsids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropsid)  (mammal like amniotes and reptile like amniotes). Clearly we mammals and the sauropsids are all [craniates.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniata)

I'm posting this quick reminder because today is the day for it, and because some readers may enjoy the well done article on the subject by [DarkSyde.]( http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/4/12/719095/-Hare-Comes-Peter-Cottontail!)
