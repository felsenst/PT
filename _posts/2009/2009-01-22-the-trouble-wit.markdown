One of the great frustrations of science journalism is its tendency to sensationalize every small advance into a worldview shattering revolution.  As a case in point, consider <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life.html?page=1">this article</a>, from the current issue of <i>New Scientist</i> magazine.

The magazine's cover depicts a plush, green tree bearing the words &ldquo;Darwin Was Wrong.&rdquo;  As P.Z. Myers <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/speaking_of_media_mangling.php">has noted</a>, it is an annoying sign of creationist influence that revisions in a 150 year old theory are considered cover-worthy.  Larry Moran makes a similar point <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/darwin-was-wrong.html">in this post.</a>  

Things get worse, oh so much worse, when you read the awful article itself.  Never have you seen a science writer try so hard to make so big a deal from such meager materials.  It turns out the breathaking news is that horizontal gene transfer among single-celled organisms means that the tree metaphor of evolution does not work so well for the earliest stages of life's history.  The article does point to a few reasons why the tree metaphor may be problematic for certain aspects of plant and animal evolution as well, but this too is mostly familiar stuff.

Over at EvolutionBlog I <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/01/the_trouble_with_science_journ.php">offer some further thoughts</a> on all that is wrong with this article.  Comments can be left there.
