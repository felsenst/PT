[PZ Myers has the video](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/the_discovery_institute_doesnt_1.php).  Quick and dirty summary: Casey Luskin is interviewed on Fox; a critique using footage from the Fox interview is posted on Youtube; the Disco Dancers claim copyright violation for material they don't own.  DMCA fail!

'Course, it's consistent with the no-comments policy on their site and the modding policies on Uncommon Descent.  I once mis-stated that as Uncommon Dissent, which more and more I think is the appropriate title.
