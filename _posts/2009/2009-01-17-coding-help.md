I'm working on a little education project for this site that requires a good binomial random number generator written in javascript.  I'm having a hard time finding a library written and would rather not write one myself.  So I'm wondering if any of the tech-savvy people who read this blog are willing to port the code for generating a binomial random variable from [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to javascript.  You can depend on the jQuery library if it helps.

Any takers?
