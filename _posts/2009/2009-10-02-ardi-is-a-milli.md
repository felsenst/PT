This week's _Science_ has a [special issue](http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/) devoted to the fossil hominid _Ardipithecus ramidus_. It looks as though you may read at least some of the 11 articles free, and you may see a video featuring (mostly) Tim White.  The fossil is interesting in part because it appears to show that certain expected traits may be absent from the last common ancestor of chimps and humans.
