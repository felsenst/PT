Last week I had the opportunity to attend the 9th North American Paleontological Convention in Cincinnati.  'Twas a grand old time, mingling with a lot of seriously excellent scientists.

Besides the excellent science, a highlight was the panel I sat on.  This session was held over lunch on Thursday, and the subject was "Countering Creationism".  I was joined by Panda's Thumb contributors Richard Hoppe, Jason Rosenhouse, and Art Hunt.

There was also a most excellent series of talks on Thursday morning.  I never knew that rodent debris could be so informative (thanks, Felisa Smith!), and I learned that Jeremy Jackson really doesn't like [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/).  I was disappointed that I missed the steel cage match between Jeremy and PZ - I never found the announcement.  Maybe I can catch the rematch ...

I got to catch up with old friends ...

And, of course, I accompanied a mob of unruly paleontologists on a field trip to some "museum".

(Looks like the sign got run over by an out-of-control ark.)

There were hints of PZ even in this museum ...

Of course, I was accompanied by other luminaries.

All in all, a delightful time.  With some functional keepsakes to boot.
