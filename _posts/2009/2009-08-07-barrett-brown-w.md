While the Huffington Post has some execrably bad aspects (its embrace of woo in health, for example), it does have the occasional gem.  For example, [this takedown of Bill Dembski](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barrett-brown/intelligent-design-online_b_253515.html) is outstanding.  Read and enjoy!

I have to say, though, that some of the comments are remarkably dumb.  Second law of thermodynamics?  Gads.  And 'That's not evolution, it's just adaptation.'  (Though they get a little lighter late in the thread -- is there golfing in heaven?)

_Via [John Pieret](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2009/08/widespread-mediocrity.html) (who else? I'm not proud).  But every time I throw him a trackback I get an error.  Hm._
