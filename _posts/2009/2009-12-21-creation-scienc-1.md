[Dr. Boli's Celebrated Magazine](http://drboli.wordpress.com/) has been in my reader for some time, and his advertisements, news articles, and answers to questions are both amusing and often satirically pointed.  Today he notes a work in preparation called ["A New Approach to Baraminology"](http://drboli.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/now-in-preparation/) by Dr. Orbin S. Thicke, Ph.D., and the Rev. Bob-Bob Lee, D.M., Fellows of the Institute for Noachian Studies.  It promises great things:

> One problem, however, has until now remained intractable: the question of which taxonomic rank properly represents the baramin, or original created kind, beyond which it is not permissible to search for common ancestors.

Read the rest there, and be sure to pre-order your copy for anticipated delivery in February 2043.  It will make a lovely gift.  For someone.  Right?  Right?
