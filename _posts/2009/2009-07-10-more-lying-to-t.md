Casey Luskin, [never](http://sandefur.typepad.com/freespace/2008/01/casey-luskin-ab.html) [what](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/dis-plagiarism.html) [you](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/06/luskin-once-aga.html) [might](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/03/pz-meyers-casey.html) [call](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/casey-luskinnot.html) [intellectually](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/the-luskin-foll.html) [honest,](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000261.html) [published an article recently](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/07/new_law_review_article_surveys.html#more) in the _Hamline Law Review_purporting to assist public school teachers in knowing what they can and cannot teach about evolution in government classrooms. The article, of course, is all centered on the basic misrepresentation in all that the Discovery Institute does: namely, the lie that "intelligent design" is a "scientific" approach or constitutes a "scientific critique" of evolution.
