Last week, Casey Luskin posted [a fairly pathetic attempt](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/my_pilgrimage_to_lucys_holy_re.html) to explain why the remains of the famous fossil Lucy are not evidence for the common descent of humans and apes. [I saw the Lucy exhibit last year](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/08/the_edge_of_humanity.php), and was going to write a response to Casey's latest tripe, but I honestly couldn't muster up the strength to deal with the nonsense. Fortunately for me - and all of us - Afarensis has done a beautiful job of dismantling Casey's claims. 

[His post, over at SciencBlogs, is really worth a read.](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2009/02/08/casey_luskin_visits_lucy/)
