<p>Some new polling data on the lack of acceptance of evolution.</p>

<p>The Discovery Institute is [touting](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/06/in_darwin_anniversary_year_new.html) a poll that they commissioned from Zogby which claims that 52% of the American public believe that "the development of life was guided by intelligent design."</p>

<p>An [Ipsos/Mori poll](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/jul/01/evolution) in the UK shows that only 33% of the American public thinks that "scientific evidence for evolution exists". This compares with 51% in Britain and 8% in Egypt. While the poll considered additional countries, over at _[a simple prop](http://jmlynch.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/new-polling-data-on-evolution/)_ I've tabulated results for Britain, the US and Eqypt (as a representative Muslim country) and made some comments on the issue of theistic evolution. Leave comments there or here (though I will  probably not be reading the thread here).</p>
