Via Kim at [All of my faults are stress related](http://shearsensibility.blogspot.com/2009/02/google-earth-explosion.html) (the all-time best name for a geology blog!), a collection of Google Earth KMZ files at San Diego State University called [Google Geology](http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/localgeology/getour.html).  How am I going to get ready to teach a 3-hour class tomorrow with all that to wander through?
