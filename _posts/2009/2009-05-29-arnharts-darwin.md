The [second edition of Larry Arnhart's book _Darwinian Conservatism_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1845401565/1n9867a-20#) is being published today. This edition adds a number of critical essays, including my own essay, "Evolution And The Limitations of Conservatism." Despite some obvious and serious disagreements, I actually admire Arnhart's work quite a bit. My thanks to him and to Ken Blanchard for inviting me to participate in this project.
