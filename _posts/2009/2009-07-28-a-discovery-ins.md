A [religious movement in Nigeria](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8172270.stm) aims to establish a government, which I can only describe as a paradise for the Discovery Institute.

> If their name is uncertain, however, their mission appears clear enough: to overthrow the Nigerian state, impose an extreme interpretation of Islamic law and abolish what they term "Western-style education". . . .
> 
> In an interview with the BBC, the group's leader, Mohammed Yusuf, said such education "spoils the belief in one god".
> 
> "There are prominent Islamic preachers who have seen and understood that the present Western-style education is mixed with issues that run contrary to our beliefs in Islam," he said.
> 
> "Like rain. We believe it is a creation of god rather than an evaporation caused by the sun that condenses and becomes rain.
> 
> "Like saying the world is a sphere. If it runs contrary to the teachings of Allah, we reject it. We also reject the theory of Darwinism."

Sounds familiar, dunnit?
