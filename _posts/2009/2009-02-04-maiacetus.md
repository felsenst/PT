Today's most heavily blogged science story is probably the discovery of a new species of early whale. A team of researchers led by whale evolution expert Philip Gingerich discovered the remains - a largely complete adult male, and a female that was carrying a near-term fetus - during field work in Pakistan in 2000 and 2004. They've named the new species _Maiacetus inuus_.

If you're interested in learning more about this fascinating discovery and what it can tell us about the evolution of whales, here are a few links to check out:
