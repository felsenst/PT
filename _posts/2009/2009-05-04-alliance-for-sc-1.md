Every year the folks at the [Alliance for Science](http://www.allianceforscience.org)
have themselves an [essay contest](http://www.allianceforscience.org/2009_essay_winners).  The topic is evolution-themed, and since 2009 is so relevant to Charles Darwin-- being his 200th birthday and 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species-- we asked students to identify a modern scientist that exemplifies the characteristics which led Darwin to make his monumental discoveries.

This year we had a very tight race...  a 3 way tie for 3rd place.  Do check out the winning essays, they are worth a read!
