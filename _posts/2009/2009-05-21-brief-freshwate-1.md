Sorry for the delay in posting on the most recent days of the hearing in early May.  I've been up to my eyebrows in alligators for the last few weeks.  I've got 50 pages of notes on the most recent two days of the hearing but haven't had the 10 or 12 hours to spare to write them up.  Soon, I think.  Meanwhile, the Mt. Vernon News ran stories on those days [here](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/05/07/freshwater-morning-update), [here](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/05/07/freshwater-afternoon-update), and [here](http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/05/09/dennis-family-wraps-up-freshwater-testimony).
