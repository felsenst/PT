Via [Jerry Coyne](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/07/transitional-fossils/), a [special issue of _Evolution: Education and Outreach_](http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1r804782707/?p=3d45207ea6724d2e9211a5a2df89e527&amp;pi=0) devoted to transitional fossils.  As Coyne notes, several of the papers include some very good teaching illustrations.
