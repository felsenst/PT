They will send a blogger along simply based on votes, a straight-up popularity contest. This seems like an opportunity that I shouldn't miss. I'm eager to compare my sartorial style with the resident penguin colonies down there, and I'm sure that dodging crabeater or Weddell seals should simply add a certain zest to the adventure for someone of my diminutive stature. 

<img src="http://austringer.net/images/pss/2005_b03_pss_wre_dscf8313_200x200.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;" /> Unfortunately, there is some speciesism involved, and I'll have to make do with using my designated Sherpa for the trip, Wesley Elsberry, as [my proxy in the voting process](http://www.blogyourwaytoantarctica.com/blogs/view/163). We're still discussing which one of us gets smuggled along in the luggage. I've told him that that is what duffel bags are _for_. Wesley makes for a pretty good Sherpa, what with his interdisciplinary background in [marine biology](http://www.onlinezoologists.com/cs/node/21) and [computer science](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805815619). He's also [handy with a camera](http://baywing.net/phot) and acoustics gear, and does [some wicked blogging](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/author/wesley-r-elsberry/) [himself](http://austringer.net/wp/). Of course, it's not a patch on my own set of qualifications, including the B. Amboo Chair in Creatoinformatics at the University of Ediacara, a J.D.-M.D.-quintuple Ph.D., and being a seven-time Nobel nominee. As the Izaak Walton of information theory and the Ulysses S. Grant of drinking contests, I can recognize talent for myself and exploit it. Sorry, the new word is _collaboration_, isn't it? We did well working together at the 2005 _Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District_ trial, and I'm looking forward to some more, er, collaboration in the cold.
