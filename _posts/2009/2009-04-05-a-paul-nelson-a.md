We missed an important anniversary last week.  It was five years ago last Sunday, March 29, that Paul Nelson told us that he'd provide a reply to [PZ Myers' critique](http://pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000048.html) of "ontogenetic depth."  Nelson said

> Quick note -- I'm drafting an omnibus reply (to points raised here and in Shalizi's commentary), with title and epigraph from a Rolling Stones song.  I'll post it tomorrow.

Yup.  And the check's in the mail, right?  I suspect the epigraph should be "(I can't get no) Satisfaction."

By tradition the fifth anniversary of an event is the "wood" anniversary.  But so far we don't even have one wooden nickel from Paul, say nothing of an omnibus full of them.  We're still waiting, Paul.
