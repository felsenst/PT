[Andrew Sullivan](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/02/when-the-theory.html) links to [Asa Gray's original review](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/186007/gray) of Darwin's OoS in _The Atlantic_ in July 1860.  Interesting reading.  Gray, one will recall, was a distinguished  American botanist at Harvard.  He was an early supporter of Darwin, an antagonist of Louis Agassiz at Harvard, and was a devout Presbyterian who one might call the first theistic evolutionist.  His argument was that the variability on which natural selection works might be guided.
