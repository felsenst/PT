I went to the [Keith Thomson lecture and Darwin's 200th celebration at the California Academy of Sciences Nightlife event](http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2008/evolve2009_release.php) last night.  The lecture was great, the wine was strong, the company was nerdy but fantastic, and the music was thumpin.  However, I'm not sure Darwin ever imagined there would be a dance party in front of a Darwin's finches display:
