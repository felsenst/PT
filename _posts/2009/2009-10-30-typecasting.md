[Paul Bettany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bettany), who plays Charles Darwin in [Creation](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/eugenie-scott-r.html), is also playing the archangel Michael in the upcoming supernatural fantasy movie, [Legion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_%28film%29).  According to the [trailers](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/legion/), Michael comes to Earth to save humanity from the God's wrath.

I hope I'm not the only one who finds this pairing of roles amusing.
