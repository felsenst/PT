There is a wide array of resources on the web about evolution, ranging from public access to technical papers available via [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed) to the excellent [Understanding Evolution](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/) site operated by the University of California Museum of Paleontology and the National Center for Science Education.  The grand daddy of them all, of course, is the [TalkOrigins Archive](http://www.talkorigins.org/).

Now a new resource has been established by T. Ryan Gregory, evolutionary biologist and blogger at [Genemicron](http://genomicron.blogspot.com/).  It's called [Evolver Zone](http://www.evolverzone.com/), and is "a resource for students, teachers, and researchers with an interest in evolution."

Evolver Zone is a collection of a wide range of resources on evolution, from [online databases](http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=193) to [software](http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=11) to [teaching resources](http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=15) to [multimedia](http://www.evolverzone.com/?cat=4) (including games!).  I haven't browsed the whole site yet, but what I've seen looks to be very useful, particularly for advanced high school and undergraduate classes.  Gregory tells us the site is a work in progress, so check back often for new additions.
