Over on the T-urf13 thread we had [a request for an open thread for questions and answers](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/11/hunter-vs-hunt.html#comment-199637).   In the spirit of the holiday season, I'm happy to oblige.  However, let's make this an experiment in attempting to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in blog comments.  I suggest:

1. This thread is not for arguing, it is for explaining.

2. Thus the issue is not whether or not person X believes viewpoint Y, the only issue is to understand/explain the science relating to Y.

3. Typically, these will be about evolution, but I imagine some people may have itching questions about climate science, given the recent denialgasm that's been going on in the wingnut-o-sphere, found in some its most extreme, pitchforks-and-torches forms on the [blogs of the Discovery Institute](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.evolutionnews.org+Egnor+climate&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS239US239&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en) (there goes Casey Luskin's attempt at pro-environment credibility, by the way) and [William Dembski](.http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.uncommondescent.com+climategate&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS239US239&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en)

4. Don't insult honest questioners who come to the thread.  Give people the benefit of the doubt.  

5. Questioners: don't take statements like "you really aren't getting it" as insults, and don't take "you need to read this reference" as a brush-off -- learning requires effort and looking stuff up, particularly learning complicated science-y stuff.

6. I will delete noncompliant posts in a fairly arbitrary and dictatorial manner, and I will take suggestions, since I don't have time to monitor the thread constantly.

Like I said, this is an experiment -- go to it!
