According to a [report](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2009/mar/20/vandals-cause-cus-biology-building-flood-police-sa/) in the Boulder Daily _Camera_, vandals tore an eye-wash station from the wall Thursday night and flooded the Ramaley biology building at the University of Colorado.  The building was damaged, but initial reports suggest that the scientific work of the faculty was unharmed. There is apparently no indication that the biology building was specifically targeted, nor that the vandalism is related to recent [threats](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/07/threats-against-university-of-colorado-biologists.html) directed against University of Colorado biologists.
