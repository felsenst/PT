In [BBC blog comments](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2009/08/some_creationists_have_been_do.html#P84451506) I find this:

> Let me repeat it for you, because you seem to be determined to misunderstand. NO-ONE is a priori excluding the presence of some sort of Primary Intelligent Cosmic Creator (PICC, pronounced "pixie"). There is no need to either include or exclude such a beastie; the only way of addressing that question is NOT by cod philosophy, but by scientific evidence.

I love the British way with words.
