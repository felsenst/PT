Francis Beckwith has published [a letter to the editor](http://www.whatswrongwiththeworld.net/2009/04/my_chapman_law_review_letter_t.html) in the latest issue of the _Chapman Law Review_ (~~not available online~~) alleging that I misrepresented his views in [my recent article in that journal.](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088905) I think my article correctly described his views and that his letter--probably intentionally--obscures the issues involved.
