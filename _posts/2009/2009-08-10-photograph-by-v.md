<figcaption markdown="span"><big>Fulgurite -- Glass formed as lightning strikes sand or soil.  Phosphate-containing sand was fused and turned into phosphite. This otherwise unknown natural phosphite explains the existence of phosphite-eating bacteria. In the center is a small granitic pebble that was trapped during the formation of the glass. A bolt of electricity traveled along its surface, leaving permanent evidence of its passage.  Tucson, Arizona, 2007.</big>
