This month marks the 50th anniversary of [C.P. Snow's famous Rede Lecture, "The Two Cultures And The Scientific Revolution."](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Cultures-Canto-C-Snow/dp/0521457300/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1243403506&amp;amp;sr=8-1) A half-century later, the term "two cultures" is still well remembered, but many of the details, both of the history and of the philosophical foundations of the dispute--and the contributions of my hero, the scientist, philosopher, and future television celebrity [Jacob Bronowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronowski)--have largely been forgotten.
