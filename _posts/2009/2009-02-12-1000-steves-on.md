The 1000th Steve of Project Steve, also known as the kilosteve, is going to be announced at the Annual Meeting of the AAAS this weekend.  See the NCSE press release: [Who will be Steve #1000?](http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/02/who-will-be-steve-1000-004304)

(PS: What's the Discovery Institute non-Steve-required-and-often-otherwise-dubious list at?  700?  Meh.  The creation scientists had a better list in the 1980s.)
