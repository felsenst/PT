Don't hold your breath, but Ken Ham, who is in Nashville for a religious broadcasters' conference, plans an [ announcement about the Ark Park](http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2014/02/24/in-nashville-but-not-to-sing/). 


> I have a few media interviews lined up over the next couple of days to discuss the debate \[with Bill Nye\] and also to share something about the Ark Encounter.


Dare we speculate?
