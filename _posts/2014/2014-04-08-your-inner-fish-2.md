It's a [3-part series](http://www.pbs.org/your-inner-fish/about/overview/) with Neil Shubin, the paleontologist who discovered Tiktaalik. The series begins tomorrow, Wednesday, April 9, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.  You can see a preview [here](http://video.rmpbs.org/video/2365146597/).  

Rocky Mountain PBS says about the series


> Anatomist and paleontologist Neil Shubin sees evidence of our ancient past in our anatomy and in our DNA. Join him as he journeys to meet our ancient animal ancestors, while revealing the impact those animals have had on our bodies


and they have an interactive webpage [here](http://video.rmpbs.org/program/your-inner-fish/).

The second and third episodes are called "Your Inner Reptile" and "Your Inner Monkey."

**Update, April 9**: An [AP release](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TV_INNER_FISH) yesterday afternoon notes that PBS will also premiere a 3-part Nova series tonight.  Tonight's episode: "Inside Animal Minds."  These 2 series, along with Nature, exemplify PBS's new "Think Wednesday" schedule, which AP characterizes as "a three-hour prime-time block of nature, science and technology programs" anchored by Nature and Nova.
