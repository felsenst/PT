John Freshwater's application to the Supreme Court of the U.S. for a writ of certiorari was [placed on the Court's docket](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/06/freshwater-the-13.html) for Sept 29, 2014, yesterday. According to the Court's [web site](http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/ordersofthecourt.aspx) 

> Scheduled order lists are posted on this Website on the day of their issuance, while miscellaneous orders are posted on the day of issuance or the next day.

It's now Sept 30, but no order list for the 29th has yet been posted.  Two Miscellaneous Orders are posted (one [granting a stay](http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/092914zr1_4315.pdf) of a lower court's ruling on the Ohio (Republican) Secretary of State's election finagling of early voting), but nothing on Freshwater is up.
