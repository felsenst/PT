... because it (gasp!) uses the word, "abortion." But wait -- [there is a glimmer of hope](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/glimmer-hope-those-arizona-honors-biology-textbooks): The new superintendent, who was ordered to offer a plan for redacting the textbooks, says that the books comply with the law already and instead plans to hold a public discussion. 

Meanwhile, as a service to the affected high-school students, Rachel Maddow has [posted the offending page](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/arizonahonorsbiologycom) on a blog, ArizonaHonorsBiology.com, which her show apparently owns. If you are curious or have a prurient interest, you may also see the verso of The Page, as well as several other pages on human reproduction.

For the record, the book is Reece, et al., _Biology: Concepts and Connections_.
