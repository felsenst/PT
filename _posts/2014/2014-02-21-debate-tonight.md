Sorry about the late notice, but we just heard about this from a commenter known as "eric".  Tonight, at 7:00 Central Standard Time (or 8:00 Eastern Standard Time), Sean Carroll will debate William Lane Craig on the subject, [God and Cosmology](http://greerheard.com/wp/). Professor Carroll is a physicist and cosmologist working on dark energy and dark matter at Caltech; Professor Craig is Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and a well known Christian apologist. You may see their biographies at the link above.

The debate is part of a forum sponsored by the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. It will be streamed live [here](http://www.tacticalfaith.com/live-stream/). Professor Carroll has announced the debate [here](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/01/28/william-lane-craig-debate/). I may report on the debate after it is over, but I will leave comments open here in any case. The amnesty on certain trolls will not be extended, however.
