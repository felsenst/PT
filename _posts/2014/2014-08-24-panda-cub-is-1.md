That cub is Bao Bao, the cub born at the National Zoo in Washington. See [here](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-zoo-celebrates-panda-cub-bao-baos-first-birthday/) for a short video or [here](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hang-there-bao-bao-panda-celebrates-first-birthday-n187561) for still photos. Bao Bao is the second panda to have been born at the zoo and survived to her first birthday. She is, of course, a distant cousin, once removed, of Professor Steve Steve.
