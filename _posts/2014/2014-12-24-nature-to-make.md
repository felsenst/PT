I would not exactly call it a Christmas present, but today I happened to learn of a [press release](http://www.nature.com/press_releases/share-nature-content.html) circulated by the Nature Publishing Group on December 2 of this year. The press release was not exactly a model of clarity, but if I understand it correctly, subscribers to any of a number of the publishing group's journals can legitimately make articles available to individual colleagues who are not subscribers. In addition, readers of "100 media outlets and blogs ... will be able to provide their own readers with a link to a full text, read-only view of the original scientific paper." 

Recognizing that "researchers are already sharing content, often in hidden corners of the Internet or using clumsy, time-consuming practices," _Nature_ has decided to "present a new way to conveniently share and disseminate this knowledge using technology from one of our innovative and disruptive divisions -- Digital Science -- to provide a real solution to the global problem of how to efficiently and legitimately share scientific research for the benefit of all." 

I consider this development very welcome indeed.
