Rosetta headquarters announced a few moments ago that [the Philae lander is now sitting on the surface of the comet](http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2014/11/live-blog-rosetta-comet-landing) and transmitting data. Unfortunately, the European Space Agency is [not exactly releasing a trove of pictures](http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2014/11/tensions-surround-release-new-rosetta-comet-data). I know this is not biology, but where did you think those hydrocarbons came from in the first place?
