Kang Lee, a 2014 Ig Nobel Prize\* winner, asks, "Have you ever seen the face of Jesus on toast? No? ... Your brain is completely normal if you see nonexistent faces in everyday objects. In fact, if you don't, your brain may actually lack the essential ingredients for a vivid imagination."

The research was actually mildly interesting, if unsurprising. I could not read the original article, which was published in a proprietary journal, but I found synopses [here](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/obsonline/a-closer-look-at-the-face-in-your-toast.html) and [here](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140506115622.htm). The gist, at any rate, seems to have been that when observers think they see a face, even in random noise, the face-recognition area in their brain lights up.

OK, it is normal to see patterns where none exist. More-imaginative people see more patterns. Fine.

But too many people who ought to know better think that such patterns are real.

\*The [Ig Nobel Prizes](http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2014) were awarded in September, but I did not catch up with them till a broadcast on NPR the other day. Dr. Lee added, by the way, "And I have some good news for you, for those without a good imagination, I just found out, you can buy a Jesus toaster on eBay ...." You may see him at about 19 min into the tape. For the record, seeing patterns where none exist is known as [pareidolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia).
