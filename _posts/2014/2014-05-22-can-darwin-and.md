Apparently not at Bryan College (yes, that Bryan) in Dayton, Tennessee (yes, that Dayton), according to an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/education/christian-college-faces-uproar-after-bolstering-its-view-on-evolution.html) in yesterday's _Times_. The college, founded in 1930, requires faculty to sign a statement agreeing to certain reactionary views on creation and evolution, including, "The origin of man was by fiat of God," according to the article by Alan Blinder. 

Several months ago, the college added a  "clarification"  to the effect that Adam and Eve "are historical persons created by God in a special formative act, and not from previously existing life-forms," according to Blinder. There is a ray of hope, however: "Hundreds" of students out of a student body of approximately 700 petitioned the trustees and opposed the clarification. Two faculty members filed a lawsuit, arguing that the college charter does not permit the trustees to change the statement of belief. A biology professor, Brian Eisenback, called the clarification "scientifically untenable" and accepted a position at another Christian liberal arts college in Tennessee.

Others argue that a college is not a church and should not prescribe doctrine, but the trustees are determined to enforce their policy. The president, Stephen D. Livesay, noted


> But this is Bryan College, and this is something that's important to us. _It's in our DNA_... \[my italics\].

I trust that I am not the only one who finds that allusion uproariously funny.
