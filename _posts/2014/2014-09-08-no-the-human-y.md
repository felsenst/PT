A friend brought&nbsp;[this 2012 news article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9099939/Male-chromosome-is-not-doomed-say-scientists.html)&nbsp;about the evolution of the rhesus monkey Y chromosome to my attention. The primary work itself is about characterizing the gene content of the&nbsp;[rhesus Y chromosome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367542)&nbsp;(a laborious, and necessary task). This particular write-up, however, is slightly frustrating for some of the (wrong) assumptions it makes, but most noticable is the image:

The picture of the "X and Y" chromosomes where the X chromosome, presumably, looks like an X, and the Y chromosome looks like a Y. If this were true, we might then assume that chromosome 1 looks like a "1" and chromsome 22 looks like a "22". None of these are true.

All human chromosomes, even the six&nbsp;[acrocentric](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acrocentric)&nbsp;chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and Y), look kind of like "X's" when they are duplicating, having sister chromatids (see this karyotype, a picture of chromosomes:&nbsp;[https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Human_Karyotype.html](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Human_Karyotype.html)). And none of the chromosomes look like X's when they are not in the duplication process (see this image from the J. Craig Venter Institute:&nbsp;[http://www.jcvi.org/cms/fileadmin/site/research/projects/huref/figure2a.jpg](http://www.jcvi.org/cms/fileadmin/site/research/projects/huref/figure2a.jpg)).
