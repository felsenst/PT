I finally watched a tape of the first installment of the new "Cosmos" series the other day. I thought it was a bit overdone and maybe a little slow, and I thought the cartoons were ghastly. (Also, there were gobs of commercials; why oh why is this series not showing on PBS?) Never once did I imagine that anyone would accuse such a completely innocuous television program of being propaganda for materialism. Yet according to a Salon [article](http://www.salon.com/2014/03/11/watch_out_cosmos_the_holy_inquisition_is_not_happy_with_you/) by Andrew Leonard, the far right has accused the program of being precisely that. Ironic that is showing on the Fox network! 

I have not looked at the primary sources, so I will have to take Leonard's word for it, but they may be right about Giordano Bruno. The conventional wisdom is that Bruno was burned for supporting the heliocentric theory, but the historian Alberto Martinez, in his book [Science Secrets](pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/02/science-secrets.html), thinks that it may as well have been because of his theological views: doubting that Jesus was born of a virgin and denying that he was actually God. Bruno was, nevertheless, an early and vigorous supporter of the Copernican theory, and only an idiot or a conspiracy theorist (but I repeat myself) would think that Bruno was introduced into the program for nefarious reasons.

**Acknowledgment**. Thanks to Walter Plywaski for showing me the Salon article.
