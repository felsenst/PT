According to a [blurb](http://news.sciencemag.org/paleontology/2014/12/three-hundred-million-year-old-fossil-fish-still-has-traces-eye-tissue) in _Science_ yesterday, researchers have discovered a fossilized fish whose eyes show traces of pigment and also fossilized rods and cones. The existence of the cones suggests that color vision developed at least 300 Ma ago. You may read the [full article](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/141223/ncomms6920/pdf/ncomms6920.pdf), which appears in _Nature Communications_, by following the link from the _Science_ article; you can read it only on screen &ndash; a pdf will cost you $32.

P.S. Yes, I learned about _Nature_'s [sharing policy](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/12/nature-to-make.html) by tracing the link from _Science_. If you follow the link to the _Nature_ article itself, you get only the abstract.
