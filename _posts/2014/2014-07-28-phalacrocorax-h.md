<big>[_Phalacrocorax harrisi_](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless_cormorant) -- flightless Gal&aacute;pagos cormorant.  Mr. Moore writes, "Having made its way to a small set of islands we now call the Gal&aacute;pagos and given sufficient food and no predators, the cormorant had no need to fly, so over the years lost its full-feathered wings. Its bright-orange companion is [_Grapsus grapsus_](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/06/grapsus-grapsus.html) -- the Sally Lightfoot crab."</big>
