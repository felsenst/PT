PZ [reminds us](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2014/04/07/today-is-the-10th-annual-paul-nelson-day/) that today is the 10th anniversary of Paul Nelson's promise to deliver an operational definition of "ontogenetic depth." Nelson said it [would be forthcoming](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html#comment-395) "tomorrow." When I was about four years old it struck me that tomorrow never comes.

And I can't resist [re-publishing this](http://www.virgilanti.com/content/limericks-about-famous-people):
