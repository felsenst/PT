was shown as part of an otherwise innocuous [PowerPoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4ni2jH9ge1SdjBLcTAwWjdNWW8/edit) to a freshman biology class at Grady High School in Atlanta and [caused a bit of a flap](http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/get-schooled/2014/jul/03/evolution-vs-creationism-why-still-issue-grady-or-/), according to _The Atlanta Journal-Constitution_. 

The teacher and the district science coordinator apparently refused interviews, but the [student newspaper reports](http://thesoutherneronline.com/frontpage/?p=29658), based on interviews with students, that the teacher did not teach evolution and seemed to favor creationism.
