<big>[Alluvial fan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan) created by the torrential rainfall 1 year ago, as seen from the Visitor Center, Trail Ridge Road, [Rocky Mountain National Park](http://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm), Colorado, September, 2014.  The meander at the bottom of the screen passes through the bed of Fan Lake, which was formed in 1982 when the [Lawn Lake Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Lake_Dam) burst and inundated the City of Estes Park.</big>
