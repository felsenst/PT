An AFP [press release](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jazBjrI8ZFm0e4fMwCtO_2WEbI3w) the other day noted that 1 in 4 Americans does not know that the earth revolves around the sun, according to a poll of 2200 people conducted by the National Science Foundation. Additionally, approximately half do not know "that human beings evolved from earlier species of animals" &ndash; or, perhaps more precisely, will not admit it. The average score on the 9-question quiz was 6.5. Americans nevertheless remain "enthusiastic" about science. The survey is part of a report that NSF will submit to the President. I could not immediately find any further information.
