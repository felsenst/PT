A report this morning on NPR asks, "[Is collecting animals for science a noble mission or a threat?](http://www.npr.org/2014/06/18/318307574/is-collecting-animals-for-science-a-noble-mission-or-a-threat)" The question is left unanswered, but the reporter notes that collecting specimens from small, isolated, and endangered species can be counterproductive, at best. Ben Minteer, an author of the [_Science_ article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6181/260.full) that inspired the NPR report (not to mention a [rebuttal](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/814.full) by around 120 other scientists), recommends photographs and DNA samples in lieu of specimens, but other researchers challenge that approach as impractical.

Also this morning, Mark Bekoff, a professor emeritus of evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado, [takes the Boulder _Daily Camera_ to task](http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_25979307/marc-bekoff-killing-urban-wildlife-is-not-euthanasia) for using the term "euthanasia" when black bears or cougars are killed for venturing into an urban environment. The animals are not euthanized, says Bekoff; they are killed. I might add that laboratory rats, for example, are not sacrificed; they are killed.

All of which raises the question: Are we too ready to kill nonhuman animals?
