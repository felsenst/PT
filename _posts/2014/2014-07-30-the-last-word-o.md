The Kentucky Tourism Development Finance Authority, in a unanimous vote, [gave preliminary approval](http://www.kentucky.com/2014/07/29/3356998/noahs-ark-theme-park-gets-preliminary.html) to $18 million in tax incentives for the [Ark Park](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/ark-park-to-break.html).

In what you might call an unusual piece of reverse evolution, Lawrence O'Donnell last night [made a monkey](http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word-with-lawrence-odonnell/watch/rewrite--noah-s-ark-park-313463875937) of Ken Ham, Biblical literalists, and the Tourism Authority. The "tape" is 8 min long and worth every moment.

Unfortunately, it will not be the last word on the Ark Park.
