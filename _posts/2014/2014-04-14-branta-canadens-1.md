<big>[_Branta canadensis_](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/canada_goose/id) -- Canada goose on nest, Walden Ponds, Boulder, Colorado, 2014. The nest is on a small island in the middle of a pond. The goose sat on her (?) nest for most of the hour or so that we hung around. Then she got up, apparently cleaned the nest, and took off for a tryst or something with her boyfriend. We could see no sign of eggs or babies, but we thought we heard a high-pitched chirping coming from the nest when the parents were gone. The geese came back a little while later, and one of them immediately sat down on the nest. We plan to check on our newfound friends every week or so and will report back if there is anything to report.</big>
