That is, are male members of the species _Homo sapiens_ idiots? No, but according to a [recent article](http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7094), they are more likely to be idiots than women are. 

The only thing surprising about this conclusion is that it is so unsurprising. For years now, whenever my daughter or I see a bicyclist dash madly across 4 lanes of traffic, we announce to each other, "Another male trying to improve the gene pool." We are uncertain who said it first, but my daughter somewhat sheepishly thinks it was she. Which, of course, makes me think that we brought her up right.

The study that drew the unsurprising conclusion looked at the recipients of the [Darwin Awards](http://darwinawards.com/) over the past 20 years. To qualify for a Darwin Award, you have to [remove yourself from the gene pool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Awards), generally by killing yourself, but I suppose that castration would do about as well.

After the usual mutterings about selection bias and noting that the study was retrospective (double-blind would have been kind of tricky), the authors conclude that ~90&nbsp;% of Darwin Award winners were male. They propose a Male Idiot Theory, which to my mind is at least as good as [Moli&egrave;re's diagnosis](http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1077&amp;context=lib_fac), she is mute because she has lost her speech.

NPR reported on the article [here](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/12/12/370414365/are-men-idiots-who-do-stupid-things-study-says-yes). Some of the comments are interesting, and some suggest a sociobiological explanation, which I will leave to your imagination &ndash; suffice it to say that among our early ancestors, only the men had to take the risk of hunting elephants. Or whatever.

The authors of the original article assure us that they plan an observational study and even now are scheduling holiday parties, both with and without alcohol.
