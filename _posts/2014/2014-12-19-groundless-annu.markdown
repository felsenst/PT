As each year draws to a close, we can expect being treated to the annual ritual of self-congratulation by intelligent design advocates.   Why, they have accomplished <i>so much</i> in the last year!  The movement is simply overflowing with ideas!  And honest, god-fearing people!  And real scientists!  And publishing successes!  Not at <i>all</i> like those dogmatic, liberal, communistic, intolerant, censoring, Nazi-like evolutionists!
<p>

2014 is no different.  <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2014/12/about_the_implo091811.html">Here</a> we have the DI's official clown, <a href="http://americanloons.blogspot.ca/2011/05/216-david-klinghoffer.html">David Klinghoffer</a>, comparing himself to Leon Wieseltier (in part because, he says, <i>their surnames sound similar</i> -- I kid you not) and the Discovery Institute to <i>The New Republic</i>.  
<p>

Actually, there are two big similarities I can think of:  when TNR tried to come up with a list of <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/feature/thinkers/">100 "thinkers"</a> whose achievements were most in line with things that TNR cares about, science didn't even merit its own category.   But theology did!  And TNR's Wieseltier wrote a <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112481/darwinist-mob-goes-after-serious-philosopher">review of Nagel's book</a> that demonstrated he didn't have the vaguest understanding of why <i>Mind and Cosmos</i> was nearly universally panned.  Wieseltier even adopted intelligent design tropes like "Darwinist mob", "Darwinist dittoheads", "bargain-basement atheism", "mob of materialists", "free-thinking inquisitors", "Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Secular Faith", and "scientistic tyranny".  Don't let the door hit you on your way out, Leon.   
<p>

Klinghoffer claims "In the evolution controversy, it's supporters of intelligent design who stand for ideas (disagree with us or not) and idealism."  Well, that's something that we can actually check.  Since ID is so brimming with ideas, let's look at ID's flagship journal, <i>Bio-Complexity</i>, and see how many papers were published this year.  ID supporters are always complaining about how their groundbreaking word is censored by evil Darwinists.  If true (it's <a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com">not</a>), then in <i>Bio-Complexity</i> they have no grounds for complaints:  nearly all of the 32 people listed on the <a href="http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/about/editorialTeam">"Editorial Team"</a> are well-known creationists and hence automatically friendly to any submission.
<p>

How many papers did <i>Bio-Complexity</i> manage to publish this year?  A grand total of <a href="http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/issue/current">four</a>!  Why, that's 1/8th of a paper per member of the editorial team.  By any measure, this is simply astounding productivity.  They can be proud of how much they have added to the world's knowledge!
<p>

Looking a little deeper, we see that of these four, only <i>one</i> is labeled as a "research article".  Two are "critical reviews" and one is a "critical focus".  And of these four stellar contributions, one has 2 out of the 3 authors on the editorial team, two are written by members of the editorial team, leaving only one contribution having no one on the editorial team.  And that one is written by Winston Ewert, who is a "senior researcher" at Robert J. Marks II's "evolutionary informatics lab".  In other words, with all the ideas that ID supporters are brimming with, they couldn't manage to publish a <i>single article</i> by anyone not on the editorial team or directly associated with the editors.
<p>

What happened to the claim that ID creationists stand for ideas?  One research article a year is not that impressive.   Where are all those ideas Klinghoffer was raving about?
Why can't their own flagship journal manage to publish any of them?
<p>

As 2015 draws near, don't expect that we will get any answers to these questions.  Heck, not even the illustrious Robert J. Marks II can <a href="http://recursed.blogspot.ca/2014/12/the-robert-j-marks-ii-information.html">manage to respond</a> to a simple question about information theory.  </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
