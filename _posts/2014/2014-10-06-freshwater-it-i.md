The Supreme Court of the U.S. today [denied John Freshwater's request](http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100614zor.pdf) (PDF) for a writ of certiorari. In other words, the Court declined to hear his case. After a legal saga that spanned more than six years and involved a two year long administrative hearing, a Court of Common Pleas review, an appeal to the state Court of Appeals, and an appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, we are finally done. After an administrative hearing that generated over 6,000 pages of transcript, and after costing the school district on the order of $1m in direct costs (not counting the indirect costs of teacher and administrator time), the case is finally at an end.

One of these days I may write a retrospective piece on the case, but for now I'm simply glad that the damned thing is over.
