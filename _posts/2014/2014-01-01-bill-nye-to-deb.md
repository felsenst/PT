Let us hope not, but a reader just sent me the following from Mr. Ham's Facebook page:


> Well the big news for 2014 as we begin this new year is that in February, at the Creation Museum, I will be debating the well known Bill Nye The Science Guy! In the next day or so we will post more details including how you can buy tickets to this event. It's quite rare these days for such a well known evolutionist to publicly debate a creationist--so we do expect a lot of media interest. For now, I just wanted to let you know about this--keep watch for details!


If it is true, I sincerely hope Mr. Nye will reconsider. There is nothing to debate, and a "debate" with Mr. Nye will only give Mr. Ham credibility that he does not deserve and increase not only his visibility but also his ability to attract investors.  May I suggest that Mr. Nye take his cue from the noted Holocaust scholar, Deborah Lipstadt, who told the magazine [Limmud](http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/2182_deborah_lipstadt_int.htm),


> If Limmud's organisers invited Lipstadt to participate in a panel discussion 
> with \[Holocaust denier David\] Irving, she would refuse point blank. "I don't debate Holocaust deniers. Putting him on a panel would mean someone lost their mind. He's a liar &ndash; why give a liar a platform?"


I sometimes bowdlerize that to "I do not debate liars," and it is a policy I recommend to anyone who is tempted to "debate" a creationist. Whether you win or lose, you will convince no one and will only add to the prominence of your opponent, who can now say, "See, I debated a prominent scientist; I must be taken seriously now." 

Please, Mr. Nye, do not "debate" with Ken Ham or any other charlatan. No good will come of it &ndash; no good _can_ come of it.

**Update, January 2, 9:30 MST:** February 4, at the Creation "Museum," $25.00. See [here](http://www.answersingenesis.org/outreach/event/Nye-Ham-Debate/).
