Or, as Right-Wing Watch puts it, [Neo-Confederate Republican Michael Peroutka Wins Maryland Election](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/neo-confederate-republican-michael-peroutka-wins-maryland-election). Mr. Peroutka operates the family foundation that donated the allosaurus fossil to the Creation "Museum," as we reported [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html). I will not synopsize the Right-Wing Watch article, but I think that you will find that being a neo-Confederate is the least of Mr. Peroutka's problems; if he is not completely crackers, he is giving a convincing imitation.
