<big>[Opposable thumb](http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=49036).  Ms. Insko submits this photograph of a fully opposable thumb as evidence of evolution and writes, "My mom and I have been voting in the photo contest as long as I can remember (I'm 10). When my mom told me the theme was how we know evolution is correct, this is my answer (and my hand)."</big>
