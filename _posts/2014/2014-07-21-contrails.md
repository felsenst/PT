<big>[Contrails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail), in the general direction of Denver International Airport, as seen from Boulder, Colorado, August, 2011.  Jeff Mitton, Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, in an [article](http://www.dailycamera.com/News/ci_26169541/Jeff-Mitton:-Could-contrails-influence-our-climate) in the Boulder _Daily Camera_, reminds us that contrails reduce diurnal temperature fluctuations and may have a significant effect on climate.</big>
