The Ohio Supreme Court today denied John Freshwater's motion to reconsider his appeal of the decision to terminate him as a middle school science teacher in the Mt. Vernon City Schools.  This brings to an end the involvement of the state courts in the affair. (I'm on a mobile and can't post a link to the case page-someone can do so in a comment.)

Freshwater's only remaining possibility is to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to grant cert. It's not known whether he or the Rutherford Institute will attempt that.
