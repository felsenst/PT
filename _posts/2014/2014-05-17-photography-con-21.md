... June 2.  That is, we will accept entries from noon, June 2, to noon, June 16, where noon is defined by the Panda's Thumb server, which thinks it is still in Central Standard Time, or UTC(GMT)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5&nbsp;h. The rules will be essentially the same as [last year's](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/07/photography-con-19.html).  We have not chosen categories yet, but please be assured that they will be all-inclusive.  So grease your shutters and be ready!

**Update, May 31:**  The theme of the contest is **History of Evolution**, by which we mean photographs of fruit flies, barnacles, pea plants; fossils, stromatolites; geological formations; anything related to how we know or have deduced common descent. We will also entertain entries in a **General** category.
