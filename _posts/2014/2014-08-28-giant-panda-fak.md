The Xinhua news agency [reported](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/08/27/famous-giant-panda-fakes-pregnancy-gets-nice-things/) the other day that a giant panda, Ai Hin, had faked pregnancy, possibly in order to receive better treatment in the form of a private room, air conditioning, and luscious bamboo. This observant and inventive panda is, of course, a distant relative of Professor Steve Steve.
