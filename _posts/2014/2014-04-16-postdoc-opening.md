<p>[The Cartwright Lab](http://cartwrig.ht/lab) at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/) in Tempe, AZ is seeking multiple Postdoctoral Research Associates in the areas of Evolutionary Genomics, Statistics, and Bioinformatics to develop methodologies and study evolutionary questions related to mutation and short-read sequencing. Successful applicants will join a rapidly growing and well-funded lab involved on a variety of active research projects and collaborations. Current projects include</p>


1. the analysis of cilliate mutation accumulation lines,
1. the development of software for de-novo mutation detection from traditional and single-cell sequencing datasets,
1. the analysis of non-pathogenic somatic mutation patterns in mammals and plants,
1. the study of indel patterns across the tree of life,
1. characterizing mutations and fitness-landscapes of metabolically engineered microbes,
1. population genetics of malaria parasites,
1. the construction of phylogenies from short-read, whole genome datasets, and
1. simulation techniques for molecular evolution research.


<p>[The Cartwright Lab](http://cartwrig.ht/lab) is part of the [Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics (CEMI)](http://cemi.asu.edu/), one of 10 research centers in [Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute](http://biodesign.asu.edu/). Research in the Cartwright Lab covers many different questions in population genetics and molecular evolution, at the interface of biology, statistics, and computer science. A majority of our research involves developing, implementing, and applying novel methodologies to study genomic datasets. Members have the opportunity to develop both dry-lab and wet-lab research programs through interactions with both national and international collaborations.</p>

<p>As part of this project, the Postdoctoral Research Associates are expected to be able to:</p>


1. Assemble microbial or metazoan genomes from short-read sequences and identify variable sites and regions.
1. Develop novel, high-throughput methodologies to study mutations from next generation sequencing of related individuals and cells.
1. Work closely with collaborators to customize methodologies to specific experimental designs.


<p>**Required Qualifications:**</p>

<p>Ph.D. in genomics, bioinformatics, or a related field</p>

<p>**Desired Qualifications:**</p>


1. Experience working with genomes and evolutionary analyses
1. Knowledge of programming languages including R, Python, and C++
1. Knowledge of statistical methodologies
1. Experience with short-read sequencing


<p>**Application must contain:**</p>


1. Resume
1. Cover Letter
1. Names, addresses, and phone numbers of three professional references


<p>**Deadline for applications is May 1, 2014. Applications will continue to be accepted and considered until the job is filled/closed.**</p>

<p>For more information see [http://cartwrig.ht/lab/](http://cartwrig.ht/lab/) or [http://labs.biodesign.asu.edu/cartwright/](http://labs.biodesign.asu.edu/cartwright/).</p>

<p>**To apply, forward one document that includes a cover letter, detailed CV, and names of 3 references to [&#099;&#097;&#114;&#116;&#119;&#114;&#105;&#103;&#104;&#116;&#064;&#097;&#115;&#117;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;](mailto:&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#119;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#103;&amp;#104;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#117;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;).** Please put the job title in the subject line of the letter.</p>
