Yeah, yeah, I know: Schizophrenia is a specific medical diagnosis, and it does not mean holding two views at the same time. But its etymology _does_ imply something like split mind, and I cannot think of a better way to describe this:

The Creation "Museum" has [put on display](http://creationmuseum.org/whats-here/exhibits/allosaur/) the _Allosaurus_ fossil that we reported on [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/10/creation-museum-1.html). And they are tickled pink. Their house geologist, [Andrew Snelling](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Andrew_Snelling), who used to do real geology (or his doppelgänger did) said of their _Allosaurus_,

> It was found with its bones arranged in their correct anatomical positions relative to each other, rather than in a scattered assortment of bones as is often the case.

The article goes on,

> Dr. Snelling added that the intact skeleton of this allosaur is a testimony to an extremely rapid burial, which is confirmation of the global catastrophe of a Flood a few thousand years ago. 

In short, the intact nature of the Creation "Museum's" _Allosaurus_ is alone proof of a global flood (not a local flood!), whereas "a scattered assortment of bones" is not evidence against a global flood. This kind of reasoning &ndash; and from a person with a PhD in geology &ndash; gives confirmation bias a bad name.

I am afraid that what Dan Phelps said in the link given above remains true: Creationists do not do research, and, worse, real paleontologists will not get to study their "nice display trophy."
