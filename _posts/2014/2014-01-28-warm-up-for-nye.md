[Dan Phelps](http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2013/10/19/who-is-dan-phelps/), president of the [Kentucky Paleontological Society](http://www.uky.edu/OtherOrgs/KPS/welcome.html), will participate in an "extended interview" with [Terry Mortenson](http://www.answersingenesis.org/outreach/speakers/terry-mortenson/bio/) of Answers in Genesis. The participants will discuss the question, "[Is teaching creationism harmful to children, society?](http://weku.fm/post/eastern-standard-teaching-creationism-harmful-children-society)" at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, Thursday, January 30, on WEKU of Richmond, Kentucky. It looks like you can get it [streaming](http://weku.fm/schedule). I will refrain from noting that modern journalism thinks there are two sides to every question, even when there are not.

Does any reader know of any other, similar warm-ups or "extended interviews"?
