The scare quotes are my gloss, but that is the headline of a credulous Dallas Morning News [article](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140814-dallas-researchers-out-to-prove-creation-with-science.ece) on the "research" being conducted at the Institute for Creation "Research." The article quotes Pat Robertson to the effect that it is silly &ndash; or, rather, looks silly &ndash; to deny the clear geologic record, but mostly the author appears to take the "research" seriously. Indeed, he makes the point that Charity Navigator gives ICR a 3-star rating, which, to my mind, means only that they waste contributions efficiently.

Buried at the tail end of the article, no doubt for "balance" (using a lot of scare quotes today; sorry), the author interviews Ron Wetherington, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University. Professor Wetherington observes, correctly, that ICR puts the cart before the horse:


> The problem is, they're not scientists. They cherry-pick data in order to use it to justify the Genesis account of creation.


Sure enough, the ICR scientists claim that spiral galaxies, ocean salinity, and the (surprising) existence of soft tissue in dinosaur bones are clear evidence against what they call evolutionary naturalism. Real scientists, notes Prof. Wetherington, constantly test their hypotheses, rather than simply "line up facts to support a hypothesis." 

Professor Wetherington is careful not to disparage anyone else's religion, which I suppose is a laudable position. But frankly when a scientist's religion teaches something that is contrary to known fact and by his own admission prevents that scientist from getting a real job in a real research laboratory, then maybe it is time to admit that it is the religious view, not the science, that needs drastic modification.
