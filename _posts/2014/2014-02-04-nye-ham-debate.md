And you may watch it [here](http://www.nbcnews.com/science/evolution-debate-plays-out-creationisms-home-turf-2D12044727) on NBC or [here](http://live.wcpo.com/Event/Bill_Nye_Ken_Ham_debate_at_Creation_Museum) on WCPO, Cincinnati.

Piers Morgan will interview the debaters on CNN at 9:45 EST, and MSNBC will interview Bill Nye during the 10:00 hour, EST.  C-Span will rebroadcast the event Wednesday, February 19 at 8 p.m. EST, according to WCPO.

If you cannot wait till the end of the debate, you may leave comments below at any time. I suggest that we allow comments from (many of) our creationist trolls, as long as they are coherent.  I will not allow comments that are merely insulting.
