I attended the Cancer Genomics Symposium, hosted at UC Berkeley ( [http://qb3.berkeley.edu/ccb/cancer-genomics-symposium/](http://qb3.berkeley.edu/ccb/cancer-genomics-symposium/)). 

A lot of great research was discussed, but it really struck me that every talk highlighted the importance of understanding evolution if we are going to tackle cancer.

My general take-home messages from the Symposium are:

- Cancers evolve, so treatments need to keep up.

- Next-generation sequencing is a sensitive diagnostic tool and allows for earlier detection.

- Therapies can be fine-tuned as we understand patient-specific and tumor-specific signals.
