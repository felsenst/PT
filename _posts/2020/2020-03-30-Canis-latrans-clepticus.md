Mr. Rice writes, "This subspecies of coyote is found in southwestern California and northwestern Mexico. Coyotes are extremely adaptable animals, whose range is currently expanding due to reduced competition from wolves and other large predators. I photographed this one in Joshua Tree National Park."
