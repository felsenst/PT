<figcaption><a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/House_Finch/overview"><i>Haemorhous mexicanus</i></a> &ndash; house finch, Boulder, Colorado, April, 2020. A very plain, drab bird, at least by our standards, and I would barely have noticed it but for the gorgeous song it was singing. I do not know about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_canary">Atlantic canary</a> (<i>Serinus canaria</i>), which is in the same family as the finch, but its domesticated descendants have nothing on this house finch. It just sat there, singing ceaselessly, until some ugly <i>H. sapiens</i> ran between us, apologizing for making so much noise. The bird flew away, and I muttered something entirely too polite. You may hear its song by following the link and pressing "Listen."
