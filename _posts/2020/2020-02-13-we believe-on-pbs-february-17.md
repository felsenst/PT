As we <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/11/we-believe-on-PBS.html">announced last fall</a>, the film <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/we-believe-in-dinosaurs/">We Believe in Dinosaurs will air on PBS</a>, Monday, February 17, at 10:00 p.m., EST.  

The PBS version, provided by Independent Lens, is a slightly shortened version, evidently designed to fit within ~~an hour~~ an hour and a half (actually 84.5 min); we <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/04/reviews-of-documentary.html">posted excerpts of reviews</a> of the full version here on PT. I have seen the complete film and highly recommend it. Besides the promotional material for the film at the PBS link above, you may also see an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unearthing-the-thorny-intersection-of-belief-religion-and-science/">interview with the directors</a> "about the, pardon the expression, evolution for this film, how they tried to tell the story in a balanced way, and what it was like to climb a fossil-infused cliff for one key scene" with Dan Phelps.

In an <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/religion/2020/02/11/pbs-air-documentary-kentuckys-ark-encounter/4667957002/">article</a> 2 days ago, the Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal asks, "What happens when religious ideology clashes with mainstream science in America?" The film goes part of the way toward answering the question.
