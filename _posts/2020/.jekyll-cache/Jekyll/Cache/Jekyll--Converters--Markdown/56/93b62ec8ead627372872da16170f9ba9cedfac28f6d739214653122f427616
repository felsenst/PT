<p>Let us all watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Believe_in_Dinosaurs">We Believe in Dinosaurs</a> together. How are we going to do that? I received an e-mail yesterday from one of the producers, Clayton Brown, who wanted to let us</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>know there is going to be an online “Watch Party” for We Believe in Dinosaurs on April 30 at 7pm Central.  What does this mean?  We’re encouraging everyone we can to  <em>rent the film on the platform of their choice</em>, then all press “play” at the same time [7 p.m. CDT] so we can all watch together.  At the same time, my co-director Monica, my co-producer Amy, and I (as well as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">David MacMillan and Dan Phelps</a>, who both appear prominently in the film) will be participating via tweet, post, etc., as well as live Q&amp;A during and after the screening.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>… I realize some folks have already seen it, but we’re suggesting they revisit it with a live commentary and Q&amp;A / discussion at the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
