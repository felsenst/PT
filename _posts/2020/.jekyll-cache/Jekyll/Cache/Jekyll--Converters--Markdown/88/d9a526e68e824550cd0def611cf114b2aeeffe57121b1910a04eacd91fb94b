<p>Though the fact seems to have escaped my notice, April 22 is <a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2020/">Earth Day</a>. March for Science, according to an e-mail I received yesterday, is starting its festivities tomorrow, April 19. Specifically, their (virtual) kickoff will stream live on Facebook, on Sunday, April 19, 4 p.m. till 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. You may register <a href="https://whova.com/portal/registration/march_202004/">here</a>. The event will be streamed live <a href="http://earthdayinitiative.org">here</a>. They advertise that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt will celebrate this historic occasion — and highlight the need for immediate action from the global community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three other events will be live-streamed later in the week:</p>

<!--more-->

<blockquote>
  <p>Wednesday, April 22, “Flatten the curve forum: Pandemics &amp; public policy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saturday, April 25, “Island resilience forum: Climate crisis from the front lines.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sunday, April 26, “Global youth forum: Champions of the SDGs [presumably Sustainable Development Goals].”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These events will be streamed live on Facebook, <a href="facebook.com/marchforscience">here</a>. I have no information as to the times, but when I registered for the April 19 event I was told that the organizer will follow up with instructions.</p>

<p>And, finally, March for Science will host a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/251820822663162/">Media Zone</a> on Facebook, about which they say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In honor of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, March for Science will convene a virtual international civic forum with curated panels and interactive participations, in the spirit of the first Earth Day teach-ins.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MFS Media Zone will provide a moderated, vetted space for sharing insights and highlighting impacts of the public health crises on different populations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>From grassroots leaders and thought leaders to students and professors, we are calling on the March for Science community to contribute to the Media Zone programming with tangible “prescriptions” and calls-to-action so that we can rally science advocates across the globe with action that is informed by science. We hope you join us.</p>
