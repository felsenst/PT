I"–<p>Recently, Eric Hovind wrote a <a href="https://creationtoday.org/eric-hovind-on-pbs-hey-mom-look-im-on-tv/">blog post</a> about the documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Believe_in_Dinosaurs">We Believe in Dinosaurs</a>. In his post Hovind stated ‚Äú‚Ä¶ after you watch the film, ‚Ä¶ you may want to consider a review on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB to let others know what they are going to encounter.‚Äù On the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) the documentary had a rating of 7.8/10 for several weeks, until just a few days ago. Suddenly, there were 12 new 1-star reviews and now (3/2/20) the IMDB rating is 6.4/10. Hopefully, you have seen the documentary and can fairly review it <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6316506/ratings">here</a> (you will have to have or establish an account with IMDB).</p>

<p>You may want to also check out what is happening at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Believe-Dinosaurs-David-MacMillan/dp/B081S9Y898">Amazon</a>, where a handful of 1-star ratings have reduced the film‚Äôs overall rating to 4.3/5 stars, and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_believe_in_dinosaurs">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, where 9 out of 10 critics assigned it ‚Äúfresh tomatoes.‚Äù</p>
