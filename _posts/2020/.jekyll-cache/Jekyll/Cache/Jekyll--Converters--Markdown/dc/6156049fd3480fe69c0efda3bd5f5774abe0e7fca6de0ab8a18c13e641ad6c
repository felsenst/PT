I"<p>At Josh Swamidass’s site Peaceful Science, <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/covid-19-genome-and-design-detection/10675?u=joe_felsenstein">there has arisen</a> some technical discussion of the detection of
Design using Complex Specified Information and Alorithmic Specified Complexity.  The discussion was originally
about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and how examining its sequences could shed light on whether it was designed or
evolved.  There was a sarcastic call for ID supporters to show that their methodology could shed light on this.</p>

<p>In the end, Dan Eastwoood, a biostatistician, and I fell to discussing where the fatal flaw was in William
Dembski’s Complex Specified Information (CSI) criterion, and another version, his Specified Complexity
criterion.  We didn’t entirely agree.  The discussion was technical, and did not involve theology, so I proposed moving it to Panda’s
Thumb.  Eastwood was <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/covid-19-genome-and-design-detection/10675/26?u=joe_felsenstein">willing to do this</a>.</p>

<p>Below, I want to outline some issues, take a position or two, and also link to some resources for this
discussion.  I trust that Eastwood will join in, and others are welcome too, provided they stay on topic.</p>

  <li>My <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html">post here at PT</a> last year as to why the Algorithmic Specified Complexity (ASC) measure is irrelevant to any argument about barriers to adaptation in evolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me start off the PT discussion by offering some possibly-controversial opinions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contrary to what a lot of my fellow defenders of evolutionary biology declare, Complex Specified Information is <em>not</em> a meaningless concept.  It is just that seeing it does not constitute evidence for Design.</li>
  <li>Algorithmic Specified Complexity (ASC) is not a sensible quantity to compute to evaluate how easy or hard it is to
evolve adaptations.  In fact it has nothing to do with adaptations and is best ignored.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, let’s discuss.  I will, as usual pa-troll this discussion against off-topic crap.</p>
