<figcaption><a href="https://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/species/Xestia-smithii">Xestia smithii</a> &ndash; Smith's dart, Boulder, Colorado, August 13, 2019. Yes, these moths are engaging in the same behavior as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Agalychnis-callidryas.html">the frogs</a> we posted a few weeks ago. Since I know someone will ask: Tony-2 at Bugguide thinks the lower one may be the male, but is impossible to be certain without seeing the antennas. Thanks to Bob Biagi for providing <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/29859">the identification</a>.</figcaption>
