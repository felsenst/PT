Recently, Eric Hovind wrote a [blog post](https://creationtoday.org/eric-hovind-on-pbs-hey-mom-look-im-on-tv/) about the documentary [We Believe in Dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Believe_in_Dinosaurs). In his post Hovind stated “... after you watch the film, ... you may want to consider a review on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB to let others know what they are going to encounter.” On the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) the documentary had a rating of 7.8/10 for several weeks, until just a few days ago. Suddenly, there were 12 new 1-star reviews and now (3/2/20) the IMDB rating is 6.4/10. Hopefully, you have seen the documentary and can fairly review it [here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6316506/ratings) (you will have to have or establish an account with IMDB).

You may want to also check out what is happening at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/We-Believe-Dinosaurs-David-MacMillan/dp/B081S9Y898), where a handful of 1-star ratings have reduced the film's overall rating to 4.3/5 stars, and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_believe_in_dinosaurs), where 9 out of 10 critics assigned it "fresh tomatoes."
