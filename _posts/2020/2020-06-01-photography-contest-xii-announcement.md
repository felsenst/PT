Since many of us are estivating on account of the coronavirus, we thought we would run our twelfth (!) annual photography contest just a little early this year. Entries will be accepted between June 5 and June 19, which gives you 2 weekends to polish your lenses or search your archives and perfect your digital techniques. The rules will be the same as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/06/photography-contest-xi.html">last year's</a>, except, obviously, that the dates will change. We will post the formal announcement at noon, MDT, June 5, and begin accepting entries immediately thereafter. We will choose a number of finalists and open voting for the winner at noon, June 22.
