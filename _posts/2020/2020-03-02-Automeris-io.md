Dr. Pavlov writes, "The photo of the moth is Automeris io, a moth whose range extends along the Eastern half of Canada and the US. I found the caterpillar and carried it home where it pupated. Approximately 6 months later the moth emerged and while I missed the actual eclosion [the emergence from the cocoon], I hung the moth on some twigs to let its wings unfurl and took a few photos, minutes after it eclosed. The wings were not yet inflated and it wasn't able to move much, which is why it made such a great model." You may find more photographs by Docta Drey <a href="https://www.drdreymsp.com/">here</a>.
