<figcaption><a href="http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/brown-marmorated-stink-bug">Halyomorpha halys</a> &ndash; marmorated stink bug. Mr. Sturtevant notes, somewhat gruesomely, "The marmorated stink bug is an invasive insect in the U.S., and many homeowners have come to detest them since they are remarkably good at sneaking indoors to share our living space during the winter. But the little white bumps near the front end are the eggs of a parasitic Tachinid fly. This little stinker is doomed to be slowly consumed from the inside while still alive."</figcaption>
