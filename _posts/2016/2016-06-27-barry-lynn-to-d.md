Dan Phelps tells us that Barry Lynn of [Americans United](https://www.au.org/) will appear alongside Ken Ham (I do not know whether in series or in parallel) on [radio station WEKU](http://weku.fm/post/ark-encounter-park-eastern-standard) in Richmond, Kentucky. 


> Ken Ham, President of Answers in Genesis will be joining us live via Skype for the show; as well as Reverend Barry Lynn, Executive Director of Americans United. Jay Hall from Kentucky's Tourism, Arts, and Humanities will be live in the studio.
> 
> We're interested in your questions and comments on the park before and during the show at wekueasternstandard@gmail.com.  You can leave a voice message at 859-622-1657 or call in when you tune in for EST Thursday morning from 11 to noon on 88.9 WEKU. \[Eastern Daylight Time = UTC - 4&nbsp;h.\]
> 
> Feel free to tweet about the topic @wekuEST and post to the WEKU facebook page.

Confusingly, Eastern Standard is the name of the show, but Richmond is on Eastern Daylight Saving Time. I am listening to Haydn's Symphony No. 90 on WEKU right now, so I assume the program will be streamed. If you listen to it, please feel free to comment here.
