We have just received an e-mail from one of the Panda's Thumb crew to the effect that [a paper "demonstrating" the intelligent design of the human hand](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146193) has been published in the refereed journal Plos One. The paragraphs that caught the crew member's attention are these:


> The explicit functional link indicates that the
> biomechanical characteristic of tendinous connective architecture between
> muscles and articulations is the proper design by the Creator to perform a
> multitude of daily tasks in a comfortable way.


> In conclusion, our study can improve the understanding of the human
> hand and confirm that the mechanical architecture is the proper design by
> the Creator for dexterous performance of numerous functions following the
> evolutionary remodeling of the ancestral hand for millions of years.

Another crew member directs us to the website Retraction Watch, [which quotes a Plos editor to the effect that](http://retractionwatch.com/2016/03/02/hands-are-the-proper-design-by-the-creator-plos-one-paper-suggests/)


> PLOS has just been made aware of this issue and we are looking into it in depth. Our internal editors are reviewing the manuscript and will decide what course of action to take. PLOS' publishing team is also assessing its processes.

The Retraction Watch paper naturally engendered the response,


> Where has tolerance and respect for the beliefs and opinions of others gone? One doesn't need to agree, but bringing in a different idea in a civil manner seems more appropriate for an academic discussion.
