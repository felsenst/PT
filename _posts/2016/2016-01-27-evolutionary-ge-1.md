ESSENTIAL DUTIES: Develops and documents requirements of software applications. Participates in on-the-job and formal training sessions concerning the design, writing, and testing of software application programs. Participates in and/or independently performs the design, testing, and documentation phases of programs. Translates predetermined logic into appropriate programming language and operating systems. Utilizes standard reference, resource, and/or procedural materials to resolve problems. Integrates multiple tools into a single, user-friendly software package, as well as providing support for the software. Operates on-line terminals and related computing equipment as required.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: Bachelor's degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field AND two years of experience in software application development, including writing computer code in one or more programming languages; OR, any equivalent combination of experience and/or education from which comparable knowledge, skills and abilities have been achieved.

DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS: Experience in translating software prototypes from Perl, Python, Java, etc into C/C++ preferred. Experience with JavaScript.

DEPARTMENT STATEMENT: The Biodesign Institute addresses today's critical global challenges in healthcare, sustainability, and security by developing solutions inspired from natural systems and translating those solutions into commercially viable products and clinical practices. The Cartwright Lab is based in the Human and Comparative Genomics Laboratory in the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University. Our research focuses on various topics in the field of computational evolutionary genetics. We develop methods and software to analyze large genomic datasets and "big data". The majority of our research is related to the detection and analysis of mutations and variation from next-generation sequencing. We are species-neutral and work on taxa across the tree of life. Recent work involves humans, cancer, bonobos, ciliates, maize, Plasmodium, Leishmania, E. coli, archaea, Solanaceae, strawberries, and Anolis.
