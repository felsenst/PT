Brandon Haught at [Florida Citizens for Science](http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=2469) does a deeper dive on the educational assessments coming out of the Florida Department of Education (DOE).

Haught shows that they redefined science performance in order to have an improvement, no matter how slight.
