<big>[_Micropterus salmoides_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largemouth_bass) -- large mouth bass, Chester, N.Y.  I am a little late with this picture, but 10 days ago I visited my brother Michael Gilman in New York. The upper picture is a large mouth bass guarding his eggs. Mike told me that they usually hatch on Father's Day. Sure enough, he sent me the lower picture, the bass fingerlings, on June 19, Father's Day. Fish, unfortunately, are not very bright, and (having guarded the nests for who knows how long) they eat their own offspring. Mike said that they saw a few fingerlings on Monday, and none since; presumably, some of the survivors are hiding. I have been a little slow on the uptake, and I decided to run these pictures on Sunday, one week after Father's Day.</big>
