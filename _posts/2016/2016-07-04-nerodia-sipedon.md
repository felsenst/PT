<big>[_Nerodia sipedon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_water_snake) -- northern water snake, with an unfortunate fish in his mouth, Goose Creek, Boulder, Colorado, June 29.  According to the clock in my camera, the topmost picture was taken at 10:37:23, the center picture at 10:37:39. By 10:38:21, less than 0.5 min later, there was no sign of the fish (not shown). The bottom picture was exposed at 10:39:07. I trust that some herpetophile will correct me if I have misidentified the snake; snakes are not within the domain of my pattern-recognition system.</big>
