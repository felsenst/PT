Ken Ham's Ark "replica" is scheduled to open around July 7, or 7/7, in part because Genesis 7:7 says "and Noah went in and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark," according to a recent [article](http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article61547932.html) and a short video by Karla Ward in the Lexington _News-Herald_. Sorry, no animals inside, but there will be a petting zoo outside. The animals inside the ark will be "sculpted."

Among other things that are possibly of interest to PT readers, Mr. Ham asserted that guidelines for hiring employees at the Ark Park "will be different than Answers in Genesis." No telling exactly what that means, but presumably they will not require employees to pass as stringent a religious test. It seems to me that they could have saved a lot of litigation by having asserted nondiscriminatory guidelines in the first place.

In passing, Ms. Ward notes that a journalist asked Mr. Ham whether he believed in the Noah story as a historical event, rather than as a piece of literature and not intended to be understood literally. Mr. Ham's response was, "Jesus referred to Noah. He's referred to as a real person and a man of great faith." That sure proves it!

Finally, Mr. Ham noted that the Ark will feature dinosaurs, but they will not be stressed. I suppose that there will be no unicorns in the Ark, because as everyone knows they got to the pier late.
