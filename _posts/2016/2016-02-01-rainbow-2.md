<big>[Rainbow](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/rbowpri.html). The rainbow is formed from relatively nearby raindrops. It is evidently raining lightly, because you can see a light cloud cover behind the rainbow. Direct backscatter from the clouds probably accounts for much of the brightness of the sky inside the arc and helps make a dramatic picture.
