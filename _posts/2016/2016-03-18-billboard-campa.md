The Sensuous Curmudgeon [informs us](https://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/anti-ark-billboard-campaign-is-proposed/) today that the Tri-State Freethinkers of Newport, Kentucky, will launch a [billboard campaign](http://www.meetup.com/Tri-State-Freethinkers/messages/boards/thread/49699637) that, as they put it, intends to "counter" the grand opening of the Ark Park in July. They have launched an [IndieGoGo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/genocide-incest-park#/) with an intended goal of $2000; when I checked a moment ago, it looked as though they had raised nearly $3100 in a single day.

The billboard will read 


>  Genocide and Incest Park <br />
> Celebrating 2000 Years of Myths 

Yes, I know, that may be a bit over the top and, except for the picture, does not obviously refer to the Ark Park. But, dammit, the Ark Park is well over the top, and I intend to contribute $18\* right away.
