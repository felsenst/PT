We apologize for the outages that PT has faced over the last few months.  Our server has been dying, and it has taken a bit of effort to migrate to a new one.

In the process, we have redesigned both our website and the our backend experience, which took a lot of migration of content.  Here are the things you will notice:

* Smoother, modern feeling layout
* Support for mobile devices
* Comments powered by Disqus

The new site is still a work in progress, and here is what we will will implement in the coming months

* Search functionality
* The Bathroom Wall
* RSS Feed
* Migration of old comments to Disqus
* Clean up of old posts which did not convert well to the new system
* More content

Please let us know how we are doing in the comments.
