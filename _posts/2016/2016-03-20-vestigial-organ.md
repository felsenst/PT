Interesting video, [Proof of evolution that you can find on your own body](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/17/11250962/proof-evolution-vestigial), deals with several vestigial organs in the human body.  It is certainly hard to see why a god might have included such organs if she had created humans by any method other than evolution. The video is only 4 min long; watch it!
