This link is a [preview](https://au.news.yahoo.com/sunday-night/video/watch/31622001/this-week-noahs-ark/) of an Australian television show about the "replica" of Noah's Ark being built out of gopher steel and concrete in Kentucky. I think it will air next Sunday, and I hope that an online version will be available soon afterward. "Sunday Night" is apparently an Australian news magazine similar to 60 Minutes in the US. 

Ken (who you callin' ~~the~~ a Messiah, bud?) Ham commented on the program [here](https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2016/05/18/bill-nye-called-who-messiah/); he seems to have been bent out of shape by a comment made by Bill Nye in the preview. Mr. Ham is an Australian native, and that may be part of the reason that the Australian channel is running the story.

The producers also interviewed the Ark Park's persistent critic Dan Phelps at length, both in a hotel meeting room in Cincinnati and on an outcrop near Big Bone Lick State Park. I have a feeling that Mr. Ham will be bent further out of shape if Mr. Phelps's comments are aired.
