A friend of mine, a theoretical physicist, has been telling me for over 30 years that we will never discover a magnetic monopole, proton decay &ndash; or the graviton. So far, he appears to have been correct, but now scientists at LIGO [have detected a gravitational wave](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html) that resulted from the collision and amalgamation of 2 black holes. The news was so exciting that the server at Physical Review Letters supposedly crashed earlier today. I got a copy of the article but, as Shakespeare might have put it, much of it was written in Greek. The 2 graphs, shown in the _Times_ article, look mighty convincing, though.

The graviton, if it exists, is the quantized particle that carries the gravitational field, much as the photon carries the electromagnetic field. I am not, alas, a theoretical physicist, so I do not know whether a gravitational wave necessarily implies a graviton. Unless I am mistaken, any classical (nonrelativistic) wave such as an electromagnetic wave or even a sound wave can be quantized, but I have no idea whether a (relativistic) gravity wave can necessarily be quantized. Perhaps some reader can shed light on the question. 

In the meantime, I give my friend a tentative score of 2.5/3: No one has yet definitively discovered a magnetic monopole, and the lifetime of the proton has not been definitively measured.

Like a commenter on an [earlier thread](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/02/do-not-talk-wit.html#comment-349881), I am very curious indeed to hear the creationists' reaction to this stunning news.
