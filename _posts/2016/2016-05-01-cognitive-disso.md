Dan Phelps just sent us an [editorial](http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/editorials/article74764672.html) in the Lexington _Herald-Leader_.  The editorial accuses Kentucky of seeking science jobs while at the same time denying science: not just evolution but also global warming, alternative energy sources, and conservation.  The editorial notes that Kentucky is "perennially short of money," in part because of tax breaks like that for the Ark Park, and concludes,


> Kentucky forgoes tax revenue to help deny science while telling students they need to learn it. In homage to coal, Kentucky dumbly stints on alternative energy technologies, or even conservation, while telling young people they need to prepare to work in advanced manufacturing.
> 
> The messages aren't just mixed, they're in open conflict.


That about sums it up.
