Just a day before a handful of candidates dropped out of the race, _Science_ ran an [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/science-campaign-trail-where-presidential-candidates-stand) on the candidates' positions "on some select science-related issues (keeping in mind that the candidates have yet to sound off on many topics of interest to researchers)." The article was necessarily a little shallow but gives a good idea where most of the candidates stand on critical issues like science policy, the space program, climate change, vaccination, and genetically modified organisms.
