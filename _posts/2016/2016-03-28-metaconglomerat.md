> I originally became interested in this rock after reading [this blog post](http://geologictimepics.com/2015/02/19/rockin-countertops-geologic-time-in-our-kitchens-and-bathrooms/). The material was hard to find in small quantities, but I found a company that sells interesting rock slabs to use as cutting boards. If you notice, my slab has handles, which I will probably remove.

> Note that individual cobbles and pebbles are made of quartzite, gneiss, and what is either a migmatite or a metamorphosed pinkish orthoclase feldspar-rich granite.  The greenish black matrix is rich in the mineral chlorite.

> 2. Lithification of sedimentary rocks that were the precursors of the cobbles/pebbles. These include sandstone, and shales and siltstones (protoliths of the metamorphic rocks in Step 3).
> 
> 3. Metamorphism of the sedimentary rocks in Step 2 by heat and pressure, resulting in quartzite and gneiss.  Some of the gneiss may have partially melted then crystallized to form a pinkish orthoclase-rich migmatite.
> 
> 4. Weathering of the metamorphic rocks in Step 3.
> 
> 5. Erosion of these metamorphic rocks into well-rounded pebbles/cobbles.
> 
> 6. Deposition of these pebbles/cobbles in a fine-grained mud.  
> 
> 7. Lithification of the sediment from Step 6. This results in a  rock type of pebble/cobble sized fragments in a fine-grained mudstone matrix and is called a diamictite.  Diamictites often represent lithified glacial till.
> 
> 8. Metamorphism of the rock formed in Step 7 forming a metaconglomerate. This occurred deep enough underground to change the mudstone matrix into greenish black chlorite.
> 
> 9. An orogeny (mountain building) event stretched many of the pebbles and cobbles giving the rock a foliation.
> 
> 10. Pressure solution causes some of the pebbles/cobbles to erode at boundaries where they touch each other.
> 
> 11. Weathering and erosion bring the metaconglomerate to the surface.
> 
> 12. Human quarrying followed by cutting and polishing of the slab.
