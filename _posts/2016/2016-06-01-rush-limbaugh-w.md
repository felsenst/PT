Media Matters [**reports**](http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/05/31/rush-limbaugh-baffled-evolution/210639) that talk-show host Rush Limbaugh said on his May 31st, 2016 show


> By the way, you know there's another factor in this, Snerdley? A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Don't doubt me on this.

I've always -- if we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn't become one of us?

This was also a topic on [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rush-limbaugh-gorillas-evolution_us_574e5de6e4b0757eaeb10be0).
