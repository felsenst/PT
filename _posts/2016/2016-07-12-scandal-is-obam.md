Dear _Fortune_/_JAMA_/Obama, I'll see your _JAMA_ article and raise you Thomas Jefferson's description of the [extinct giant sloth _Megalonyx_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalonyx), "A memoir on the discovery of certain bones of a quadruped of the clawed kind in the western parts of Virginia."

Take that Obama! 

I'm sure sticklers and losers might say this was only published while Jefferson was Vice-President, in 1799. But that's even more impressive, I'm sure Veeps don't get kid-glove peer-reviews like POTUS does.

Also see Jefferson's scientific correspondence while sitting as president, March 4, 1801 to March 4, 1809: 

[http://founders.archives.gov/index.xqy?q=philosoph\*+OR+science+Author%3A%22Jefferson%2C+Thomas%22+Dates-From%3A1801-03-04+AND+Dates-To%3A1809-03-04&s=1111211113&sa=&r=1&sr=](http://founders.archives.gov/index.xqy?q=philosoph*+OR+science+Author%3A%22Jefferson%2C+Thomas%22+Dates-From%3A1801-03-04+AND+Dates-To%3A1809-03-04&amp;s=1111211113&amp;sa=&amp;r=1&amp;sr=) 

And, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalonyx), 

> As a result of presenting his paper, Jefferson is often credited with initiating the science of vertebrate paleontology in the United States. In 1799 Dr. Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as those of a giant ground sloth. In 1822 Wistar proposed naming the species _Megalonyx jeffersonii_ in honor of the former statesman.

Did Obama get a sloth named after himself? I don't think so!

Also, Jefferson was president of the American Philosophical Society, the country's oldest scientific society, from 1797 to 1814. I haven't seen Obama preside over any scientific societies lately, have you?

Clearly this is an outrage! Someone tell Donald Trump, Ph.D.! (aka @ScientistTrump) ([https://twitter.com/scientisttrump](https://twitter.com/scientisttrump))
