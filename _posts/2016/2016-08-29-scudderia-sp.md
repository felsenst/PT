<big>[_Scudderia_ sp.]( http://bugguide.net/node/view/7130) --  Scudder's bush katydid nymph, bedded down for the night in the flower of a lily (_Lilium maculatum_ \[?\]). Not shown in this view are the several species of ants that have also found this refuge to be congenial. For (temporarily) flightless insects, such cover must have some survival value.</big>
