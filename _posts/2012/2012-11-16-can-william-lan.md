I haven't the foggiest idea, but I recently saw a video, which you may link to [here](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/william-lane-craig-argues-that-animals-cant-feel-pain/), in which Mr. Craig, a Christian apologist, argues that (nonhuman) animals cannot feel pain but only responses to stimuli.  Or if they can feel pain, then they do not know it is pain.  And if they can feel pain but do not know it is pain then it is not pain.  Or something.

My unsolicited advice to Mr. Craig:  Study today's (Nov. 16) [Non Sequitur cartoon](http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur) very, very carefully.
