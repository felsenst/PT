Tomorrow, February 12, is Darwin Day, and you can find lots of lectures and whatnot through next weekend at the website of the [International Darwin Day Foundation](http://darwinday.org/events/). If you live near a university, you might also want to Google the words "Darwin Day" along with the name of your university, because the Foundation's listing is apt to be incomplete.  If you want to announce any events here, please do so in the comments section.
