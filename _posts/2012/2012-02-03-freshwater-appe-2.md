I've learned that leave has been granted for acceptance of the _amicus_ briefs from the Dennis family and NCSE. The briefs in the case are now complete (see [NCSE's compilation](http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/freshwater-termination-hearing)). I'm told that Freshwater requested an expedited hearing, meaning that only the initially submitted briefs--plaintiff's, defendant's, and the two _amicus_ briefs--will be in play. The case has been submitted to the appeals court where it will be heard by a three judge panel. They may or may not schedule oral arguments. If they do, I'll try to be there.
