Phylogenetics and population genetics, that is. Larry Moran [calls attention](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2012/12/ann-gauger-describes-intelligent-design.html) to the confusion of Ann Gauger, ID-pushing BioLogic Institute "researcher." My [favorite comment](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2012/12/ann-gauger-describes-intelligent-design.html?showComment=1355638227551#c6723614236284790383) in the thread is from (PT crew member) Joe Felsenstein:

> I must be totally confused. I wrote a book on reconstructing evolutionary trees -- and it's the standard textbook in that area. But it does not mention many basic population genetics concepts. I have another book (a free downloadable e-book) that is a textbook of theoretical population genetics. And it does not mention homoplasy at all.
> 
> So I must misunderstand what "population genetics" is. And here I've been giving courses on it for the last 44 years. At the university where Ann Gauger got her Ph.D. degree, for that matter.
> 
> Silly me.

My [second favorite](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2012/12/ann-gauger-describes-intelligent-design.html?showComment=1355627110886#c5687528338188957839) is from Piotr Gasiorowski:

> Precisely. The cult members gather in mock laboratories full of imitation equipment, where they mimic the way scientists speak and behave.
