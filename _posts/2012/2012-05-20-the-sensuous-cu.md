One of my favorite bloggers is [The Sensuous Curmudgeon](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com). He exemplifies the holy writ of curmudgeonhood, "The Curmudgeon's Handbook," a compendium of extracts from historical curmudgeons (Mencken was prominent among them) that I read more than four decades ago and can no longer find. I can only dream of aspiring to the heights SC regularly reaches. He recently vented about creationism in a post titled [The Curmudgeon's Guide to Creation Science](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/the-curmudgeons-guide-to-creation-science/ ). (Well, he actually vents regularly, but this one is a keeper.) Highly recommended!
