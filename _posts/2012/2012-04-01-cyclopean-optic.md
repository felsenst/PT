Cyclopean here means one-eyed (note the lens on the left flange). Never mind that the dictionary thinks it means gigantic; we have plenty of synonyms for gigantic. The antenna responds to centimeter waves and is [ tuned to detect pheromones](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Electromagnetic+communication+and+olfaction+in+insects.-a0163395921). The waveguide has only one internal organ, which serves as both mouth and rectum; it is especially well adapted to politics.
