<big>~~Limestone~~ Geyserite terrace, [Yellowstone National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park).</big> I took this picture in 1964 and think it ~~may be Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces~~ Is Grand Prismatic Spring in [Midway Geyser Basin](http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/midway.htm). I returned in 2002 but could not find the same location. Alas, I still do not keep a good notebook.
