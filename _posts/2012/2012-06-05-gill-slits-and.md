Troy Britain at [Playing Chess with Pigeons](http://pigeonchess.com/2012/05/31/gill-slits-by-any-other-name/) does an exceedingly thorough job on creationist and IDist blather about gill slits in embryology, and in the process provides some nice historical context. Recommended.

And for the "ID isn't religious" crowd out there, IDists Ann Gauger and Douglas Axe of the Disco 'Tute's Biologic Institute, along with the DI's attack gerbil Casey Luskin, have a new book called [Science and Human Origins](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Human-Origins-Ann-Gauger/dp/193659904X) coming out in which they "...debunk recent claims that the human race could not have started from an original couple." An intelligent design argument for a literal Adam and Eve, anyone? The Discovery Institute is becoming more and more overtly creationist, with apologetics overwhelming any scientific aspirations it might once have had. And after all, what do those dumb population geneticists know?
