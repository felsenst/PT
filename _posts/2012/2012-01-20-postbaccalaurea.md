Do you know of any graduating or recently graduated baccalaurate students who are considering graduate school?  Do they come from disadvantaged backgrounds or belong to underrepresented groups in biomedical sciences?  If so, then ASU has a program built for them: [ASU PREP](http://graduate.asu.edu/prep).

PREP scholars spend 75% of their time working as technicians on a research project under the direction of an experienced ASU faculty mentor, in a laboratory with PhD graduate students and/or postdoctoral fellows. The program director and faculty advisory committee help scholars identify the research area and mentor that best matches the interests and goals of each scholar. Scholars receive a salary of $21,000 per year. Scholars participate in a one to two year program, dependent on each individualized development plan.

Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents that have completed their undergraduate degree from an accredited U.S. college or university within the last three years. Applicants must intend to apply to a Ph.D. graduate program within two years. Individuals who contribute to the diversity of the graduate student community and to the biomedical or behavioral sciences, at ASU and nationally, are strongly encouraged to apply.

**Application deadline is March 30, 2012**

See http://graduate.asu.edu/prep for full details and application instructions.
