<big>[_Streptopelia decaocto_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Collared_Dove) - collared dove.</big> In my neighborhood, at least, the collared dove, an invasive species, appears to have almost completely replaced the mourning dove (_Zenaida macroura_) within a very few years. The call of the mourning dove used to be rare, but now we hear the call of collared dove every day.
