That is the title of a [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gHbYJfwFgOU) video by Bill Nye, the Science Guy. The punchline is essentially this,


> And I say to the grownups, if you want to deny evolution and live in your world, in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe, that's fine, but don't make your kids do it because we need them. We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the future. We need people that can--we need engineers that can build stuff, solve problems.

An appalling fraction of the comments are negative. 

See also [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/08/28/bill_nye_the_science_guy_isn_t_dead_despite_what_twitter_tells_you_.html) for an article to the effect that reports of Mr. Nye's death are exaggerated.

Acknowledgment. Thanks to Yan Linhart for notifying me about the Slate article.
