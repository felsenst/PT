<big>[Transit of Venus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_2012), Boulder, Colorado, June 5, 2012.</big> This picture was taken by projecting an image of the sun onto a smooth, white cardboard, using an 8x25 monocular fixed to a tripod. The eyepiece of the monocular was adjusted to project an image approximately 0.5 m from the eyepiece. The monocular had a pair of erecting prisms, so the image at the focus of the objective is erect; the image on the screen is therefore inverted. The printing on the cardboard was an aid to focusing; the camera was handheld. Unfortunately, there was a cloud cover most of the day; if you look closely, you can see both clouds and sunspots.
