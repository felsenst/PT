For my sins I'm on AIG's emailing list, so I get regular invitations to various YEC and apologetics events. I got this one just the other day:

> Voddie Baucham at Proclaiming the Faith 2012
> 
> We are excited to announce that Dr. Voddie Baucham of Voddie Baucham Ministries and pastor of the Grace Family Baptist Church in Spring, Texas, will be joining us at the Proclaiming the Faith family conference in Branson Missouri this July! Voddie was one of the favorite speakers with us two years ago at our family conference in Sevierville, Tennessee.
> 
> The following quote from Grace Family Baptist website describes Dr. Baucham's unique style of teaching:
> 
> Voddie makes the Bible clear and demonstrates the relevance of God's word to everyday life. However, he does so without compromising the centrality of Christ and the gospel. Those who hear him preach find themselves both challenged and encouraged.
> 
> > Voddie's area of emphasis is Cultural Apologetics. Whether teaching on classical apologetic issues like the validity and historicity of the Bible, or the resurrection of Christ; or teaching on biblical manhood/womanhood, marriage and family, he helps ordinary people understand the significance of thinking and living biblically in every area of life.
> 
> Joining Dr. Baucham will be Todd Friel from Wretched Radio, Mark Spence of Ray Comfort's School of Biblical Evangelism, Ken Ham, and all your favorite AiG speakers.
> 
> This is a summer experience you don't want to miss! Bring your whole family for a week of fun, teaching, and a challenge to proclaim your faith.
> 
> Register online today at www.proclaimingthefaith.org.

I don't think I could take Ken Ham and a Ray (Banana Man) Comfort minion on the same program. I don't have [Jason Rosenhouse's forebearance](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jason-rosenhouse/among-creationists/).
