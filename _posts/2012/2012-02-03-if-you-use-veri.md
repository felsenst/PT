Since January 10, 2012, I've been unable to connect to my email or any of the web applications serving Antievolution.org, Austringer.net, and TalkDesign.org from my Verizon FIOS residential internet service account. The servers hosting those are on a Verizon FIOS Business service account.

This isn't a problem with the servers. I'm able to access everything fine via my smartphone or from other ISPs.

This isn't a problem just at my house. My parents' ISP is Verizon FIOS, and they've been unable to access the Austringer blog since January 10th, too.

This limits my efficiency on dealing with things if my home internet doesn't actually get me to the sites I do system administration on and the email where various lists are handled. I'm using AnonymoX just to be able to hit various sites in my browser, which is a real pain.

The favor: **If you have Verizon FIOS**, try pulling up [the Austringer blog](http://austringer.net/wp). If you have the same problem, your browser will timeout rather than display anything. Please leave a comment saying whether you were successful or unsuccessful in getting the blog. If you are unsuccessful, I'd really appreciate it if you could enter a ticket with Verizon technical support. Reference ticket numbers TXP08R8CY and FLCP08R8EN if you put in your own ticket. I've had tickets in since January 10th, but no solution has turned up, and a high-level Verizon network person tonight seemed to be on the verge of cancelling the tickets that are currently active without fixing the problem.
