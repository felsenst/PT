It looks like the trial in Coppedge v. JPL has finally started after many, many delays.  The Discovery Institute appears to be attempting to milk it and spin it for all it's worth -- and of course they are accusing the "Darwinists" of doing this.  The reality, though, is that we don't know anything more than what can be gleaned from the news reports and DI propaganda (and the court filings, if anyone is brave enough to dig through that tedium), and the various evolution folks have said relatively little about it as a result.  JPL hasn't released very much information -- probably a good plan.  But links, discussion, etc. welcome in this thread.
