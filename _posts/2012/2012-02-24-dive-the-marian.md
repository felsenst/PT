The deepest spot in the earth's oceans is the Challenger Deep in the [Marianas Trench](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench) in the western Pacific, at 10,994 meters. The BBC has a [magnificent interactive graphic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17013285) of the Trench. Pause as you descend to play the clips at various depths. (And yes, you'll see the same CIO dating commercial at every stop!)
