Drew Kerkhoff, an ecologist and associate professor in biology and mathematics & statistics at Kenyon College where I'm an Affiliated Scholar in Biology, has a new blog, [Biogeocoenosis: _The Grandeur in this View of Life_](http://biogeocoenosis.wordpress.com). He plans to blog about "... the Earth as a diverse, integrated, evolving system." Drew is a sharp guy, and I commend Biogeocoenosis to your attention (even though the grey-on-white typeface is hard for my old eyes).
