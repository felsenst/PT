I see that Robert Asher has offered [a belated reply](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/11/god-as-a-superh.html) to a blog post I wrote earlier this year, in reply to a post of his over at HuffPo.  I thank him for taking the time to reply, as I enjoyed reading his thoughts.  However, I am sure that no one will be shocked to learn that I have not been moved by his remarks to revise anything I said in my original post.  I provide [a reply to his reply](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2012/11/29/a-reply-to-robert-asher/) over at EvolutionBlog.  Comments can be left there.
