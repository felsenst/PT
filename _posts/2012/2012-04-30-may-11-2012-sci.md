This should be of broad interest: a symposium at Stanford School of Law on the 1987 Supreme Court decision _Edwards v. Aguillard_.  This is the decision that ruled "creation science" to be a sham devised to promote religion in the classroom.  And, of course, the decision led directly to the decision to drop creationist terminology and adopt "intelligent design" terminology.
