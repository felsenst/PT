I recently acquired the new book ["The Rocks Don't Lie: A Geologist Investigates Noah's Flood"](http://www.amazon.com/Rocks-Dont-Lie-Geologist-Investigates/dp/0393082393/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346860418&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+rocks+don%27t+lie) by David Montgomery.  It's a splendid read, and very much applicable to the readership of Panda's Thumb.  The book has some excellent pictures and discussions regarding Siccar Point in Scotland, "_**...celebrated as the place where Scottish farmer James Hutton discovered geologic time.**_."  Siccar Point graces the cover of Montgomery's book. 

Just last Thursday, I cited Siccar Point in a [lecture on the Flood](http://www.passcal.nmt.edu/~dthomas/classes/SS189flood.pdf) for our new social studies class at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. (See slides 56-58).  I have resolved to visit Siccar Point - it's on my bucket list.

That's why I found this announcement from the Facebook group "[**Save Siccar Point**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-Siccar-Point/463995490307088)" to be quite disturbing.  They are alarmed that developers are "ruining the geological mecca of Siccar Point, the location of Hutton's unconformity."
