Read alla bout it! [Radical Muslim organization Answers in Koran opens theme park in Kentucky](http://leoweekly.com/news/sacred-playgrounds).  In rare display of ecumenism, governor promises additional theme parks dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism, Mormonism, and Scientology:

> Gov. Beshear \[says\] that even though he might not agree with the religious message of the park, the economic benefits of Koran Kountry make it worthy of his administration's support.
> 
> "I wasn't elected to debate religion," Beshear said. "I was elected to create jobs."

Thanks again to Dan Phelps for the link.
