On Facebook (yeah, I've got an account that I look at occasionally), Genie Scott calls attention to [David Bailey's analysis](http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/evolution/scientists-evolution.php) of the [Disco 'Tute's list](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=660) of "Scientific Dissent\[ers\] from Darwinism," which is now up to 854 signators by my count. There were 840 names on the list when the analysis was performed last April. I quote from Bailey's conclusion:

> In short, no matter how one objectively compares these lists, it is a fair conclusion that several hundred times as many well-qualified professional scientists accept the main precepts of evolution as dissent from them. 

Add to that the wishy-washy wording of the "Dissent," and one has mush.
