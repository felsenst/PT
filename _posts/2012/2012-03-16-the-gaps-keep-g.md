As we all know, _[Tiktaalik roseae](http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/)_ is a magnificent example of a transitional fossil connecting aquatic critters--fish--with tetrapods, 4-limbed critters. Nevertheless, there are still gaps in that transitional sequence. A [recent PNAS paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/27/1117332109) (link to abstract; full paper is behind a paywall) describes fossils of early amphibians that are later than _Tiktaalik_ and are within [Romer's Gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romer%27s_gap). Romer's Gap is a period around 15 million years long, from roughly 360mya to 345mya, where (up to now) there was a distinct lack of fossils of proto-tetrapods or related critters. The new PNAS paper's senior author is [Jenny Clack](http://www.theclacks.org.uk/jac/), one of the most prominent paleontologists studying that era, (along with people like [Neal Shubin](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/shubin_n.html) and [Per Ahlberg](http://www.galilean-library.org/site/index.php/page/index.html/_/interviews/per-ahlberg-evolution-and-palaeontology-r50). Per was an active commenter on the late lamented Internet Infidels Discussion Board way back when I was an administrator of IIDB.

With these new fossils, the transition from water to land animals is becoming nearly as well documented as the [synapsid to mammal transition](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional/part1b.html).
