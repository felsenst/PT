As one gets older one learns to ration one's obsessions. I don't play Angry Birds, stayed away from SimCity, and  successfully avoided first-person shooters. However, there's a web toy that's about to capture me: The [Allen Brain Atlas](http://www.brain-map.org/). I've only recently managed to fade out exploring [synteny viewers](http://animalgenome.org/VCmap/), but I fear that wandering around gene expression networks will capture whatever leisure time that frees up.
