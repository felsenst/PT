<p class="lead">Some poor young girl, deeply miseducated and misled, wrote into a newspaper with a letter trying to denounce homosexuality with a bad historical and biological argument. She's only 14, and her brain has already been poisoned by the cranks and liars in her own family&hellip;it's very sad. Here's the letter &mdash; I will say, it's a very <i>creative</i> argument that would be far more entertaining if it weren't wrong in every particular.</p>

<div class="center"><a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2012/10/ducks.jpg"><img src="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2012/10/ducks.jpg" alt="" title="ducks" width="339" height="681" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7512" /></a></div>

<p>I've transcribed it below. I couldn't help myself, though, and had to, um, <i>annotate</i> it a bit.</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: comic sans MS"><p>Homosexuality, including same sex marriage, is not an enlightened idea <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[But tolerance and acceptance of diversity are]</span>. The Romans practiced homosexuality <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Every culture has had homosexual individuals; they differ only in the degree of suppression. The Romans actually regarded homosexuals as effete and inferior, and used accusations of gayness as expressions of contempt, just like modern middle schoolers]</span>. Surely, after 2000 years, our level of intelligence should have evolved somewhat, so that we can truly pride ourselves of being cleverer than our forebears <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Two millennia is actually a short span of time for biological evolution. Also, have you ever heard of the Dark Ages? Progress is not inevitable]</span>.
</p><p>
If homosexuality spreads, it can cause human evolution to come to a standstill <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Nope. Homosexuals reproduce. Homosexuality refers to behavior and social preferences, not to biological limitations. Also, many heterosexuals choose to not reproduce as well, and it does not stop evolution in its tracks &mdash; in complex social organisms like ours, there are many ways to contribute to the species that don't involve breeding directly]</span>. It could threaten the human position on the evolutionary ladder <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[There is no evolutionary "ladder". You have some serious misconceptions about biology, young lady!]</span>, and say, ducks, could take over the world <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Evolution is not about taking over the world. There is no pinnacle. Every species has a different niche, not a different spot in a hierarchy of dominance]</span>. Ducks always nest in pairs <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[This is called the naturalistic fallacy. You cannot draw conclusions from how one species behaves and declare that it justifies one specific kind of behavior in another species. I could point to gorillas, and announce that we should live in polygamous harems; I could point to bonobos and say that public homosexual acts ought to be accepted as a matter of course, and that we ought to have casual sex as often as we say hello. If you'd like, I could give you a long list of very kinky sexual behaviors practiced by various species on the planet; shall we decide that because <a href="http://www.cracked.com/funny-2938-duck-rape/">ducks rape</a>, so should we, lest we fall behind evolutionarily?]</span> and if we allow same-sex marriage, then the ducks will have evolved further than we have <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Ducks are just as "evolved" as we are, and we're not more evolved than any other species on the planet. Evolution is about branching trees, not climbing ladders]</span>. We will be in danger of all being equal, with ducks more equal than us <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[That makes no sense]</span>.
</p><p>
We should learn from history and not be stuck with copying ancient behavior <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Are you, by any chance, a follower of Jesus or Mohammed? Because you know, those faiths are all about imposing ancient rules for behavior on modern society]</span>. The government has no right to bring us back to the stone age <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[But the Middle Ages are OK, I suppose?]</span>. I don't want my children to have to compete with ducks <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Wait. I'm trying to puzzle this out. Because you think ducks are all heterosexual, and your children will all be heterosexual (brace yourself, you might get a few surprises in 10 or 20 years there), and a policy of tolerance will turn every other human being homosexual, you're afraid your kids will be competing for mates with ducks? Or is it that duck heterosexuality is the only criterion that makes them acceptable for positions of power, so years from now, your children will find themselves in a workplace dominated by duck bosses, who have overcome the handicap of lack of manipulatory appendages and very small brains to be in charge of everything? I don't get it]</span>. I want them to evolve further than I have <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[But you don't believe in evolution!]</span>. Any self-respecting human would aim for that, too. <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[Are you aware that the Abrahamic faiths all preach that humanity is in a state of ineluctable decay since the Fall and that human sin corrupts us? I don't think any self-respecting human should be a Christian or a Jew or Muslim, for the same reason]</span>
</p><p>
None of this really bears any weight for be, because I do not believe in evolution <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[You don't understand it, either]</span>. However, the powers that be believe in evolution, and have made many decisions based on it. They should be consistent: if you believe in evolution, then you can't be in favour of homosexuality <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[If you accept evolution, then you recognize that there are diverse successful sexual strategies in the world, and you also have a deeper appreciation of the complexity of biology, so no, you should be much more accepting of reality]</span>, or the ducks will get you in the end <span style="color: red; font-family: Georgia MS">[You can live your life in fear of ducks, or you can love your fellow human beings and encourage more love in the world. Your choice]</span>.
