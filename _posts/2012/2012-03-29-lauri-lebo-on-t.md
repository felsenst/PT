In view of [Nick Matzke's post](pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/03/who-is-turning.html) on the Tennessee creationism-inspired bill just below, I don't know how I missed this, but via [The Sensuous Curmudgeon](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/lauri-lebo-on-tennessee-in-scientific-american/) I just learned of [Lauri Lebo's detailed article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=scopes-creationism-education) on it at Scientific American. Highly recommended.
