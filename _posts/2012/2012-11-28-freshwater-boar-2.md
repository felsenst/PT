You will recall that attorneys for the Mt. Vernon Board of Education moved to strike parts of his merit brief, the document that makes his argument to the Ohio Supreme Court to overturn his termination as a middle school science teacher in Mt. Vernon, Ohio. The Board's argument was that his merit brief included Propositions of Law that are significantly different from those in his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, the document on which the Court's acceptance of the case was based. I described that in [Freshwater: The bait and switch laid out](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/09/freshwater-the-11.html).

This morning I was notified that the Court has denied that motion to strike. The notification reads in full:

> DECISION: Denied   Ref: Motion to strike propositions of law 1 & 2, appendix pages 49 & 55-56, and supplement pages 103-116 from the merit brief of appellant
> 
> Notification Date/Time: 11/28/2012 9:15:28 AM

The ruling is not yet on the [case documents site](http://www.supremecourtofohio.gov/clerk/ecms/resultsbycasenumber.asp?type=3&amp;year=2012&amp;number=0613&amp;myPage=searchbycasenumber.asp). That should be up sometime in the next 24 hours. If it says more than the notification I received I'll flag it here.

I find the ruling inexplicable: Why would the Court accept a case on one set of Propositions of Law but then permit the appellant to argue his case on the basis of a different set Propositions? Beats the hell out of me.
