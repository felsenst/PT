<p>_Intelligent design news, commentary and discussion from the 11th of February to the 19th of February, 2012._</p>


<p>So, it happened again: the Discovery Institute [decided to notice](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2012/02/what_it_means_t056441.html) something I wrote about them. I'm not sure if it's because I write for _The Panda's Thumb_Â and they see me as the weakest, undergraduate link in its strong chain of esteemed, proper biologists, or because my criticisms of their ideas are annoying, but they seem to focus on me quite a lot. Ah well, any recognition is good recognition, right?</p>


<p>This week I'll be focusing mostly in their response to me, but also on the Discovery Institute's move into the iAge (which must be very exciting for them), as well as a curious post that highlights yet another major problem with the way the intelligent design movement operates.</p>
