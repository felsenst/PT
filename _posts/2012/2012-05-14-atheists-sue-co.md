Yes, you read that right. According to an [article](http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120427/METRO02/204270403/1361/Atheist-group-sues-Rochester-Hills-country-club-over-canceled-speech) in the Detroit News, the Center for Inquiry has sued a country club for canceling a speech by the distinguished biologist Richard Dawkins, allegedly because the owner of the country club did not want "to associate with certain individuals and philosophies." From our "if I did that, then you would ..." department, imagine the outrage if someone had canceled a speech on finding out that the speaker was a religious fundamentalist. What is the difference?
