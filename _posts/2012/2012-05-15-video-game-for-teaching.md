I sent [ this link](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/739831580/a-3d-biology-video-game-for-the-kinect) to an AP biology teacher, who pronounced it "cool" and forwarded it to other teachers in his district. The link describes a project by three scientific animators to develop a video game to teach the internal working of the cell -- and presumably make it fun. The organizers of the project are seeking what I would consider fairly modest support through Kickstarter.  As of this writing, they have a long way to go before the deadline, May 30. I intend to make a smallish pledge and encourage others to do so as well.
