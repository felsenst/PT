[This meme](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/02/what-i-do-meme-may-be-immortal/48763/) has been going around.  Recently someone did [What Scientists Do](http://labhomepage.com/887/trivia/getting-in-on-the-what-they-think-meme/), so...it's time for evolutionary biology.  Obviously YMMV if you're not an evohacker, but even you field biologists end up coming to us in the end anyway when you have to turn your pet hypothesis into a statistically testable model. (Insert maniacal laughter.)
