Afarensis, a blogger on (mostly) paleontology, has [started a series of posts](http://afarensis99.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/book-review-science-and-human-origins-chapter-one-part-one/) reviewing the Disco 'Tute's "Science and Human Origins." Recall that Paul McBride also did a [chapter by chapter review](http://apomorph.blogspot.co.nz/2012/06/science-and-human-origins-chapter-1.html) that hammered the book a few months ago.
