[Course page here](https://www.coursera.org/course/geneticsevolution).  Course description:

> Introduction to Genetics and Evolution gives interested people a very basic overview of the principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, and why animals behave the way they do.  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better and tries to clarify some misconceptions.  No prior coursework is assumed.

Topic outline:

> \*Evidence for evolution  
> \*Introduction to basic genetics  
> \*Recombination and genetic mapping simple traits  
> \*Complications to genetic mapping  
> \*Genes vs. environment  
> \*Basic population genetics and Hardy-Weinberg  
> \*Gene flow, differentiation, inbreeding  
> \*Natural selection and genetic drift  
> \*Molecular evolution  
> \*Evolutionary applications and misapplications  
> \*Adaptive behaviors and species formation

Taught by Mohamed Noor, Earl D. McLean Professor of Biology at Duke and (IIRC) Jerry Coyne Ph.D. Ten weeks, 5-6 hours per week workload. Free!
