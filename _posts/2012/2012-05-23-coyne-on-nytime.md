I read [Public money finds back door to private schools](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/education/scholarship-funds-meant-for-needy-benefit-private-schools.html?pagewanted=all) in the NYTimes last night and planned to post on it this evening, but [Jerry Coyne beat me to it](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/government-money-goes-to-fund-creationism-and-athletes/). I'll quote just a bit from the story and refer you to Coyne's post:

> Mr. Arnold, the headmaster of the Covenant Christian Academy in Cumming, Ga., confirmed that his school used those texts but said they were part of a larger curriculum.
> 
> "You have to keep in mind that the curriculum goes beyond the textbook," Mr. Arnold said. "Not only do we teach the students that creation is the way the world was created and that God is in control and he made all things, we also teach them what the false theories of the world are, such as the Big Bang theory and Darwinism. We teach those as fallacies."

With creationist books from [Bob Jones University](http://www.bjupress.com/category/Textbooks+&amp;+Supplies) and [A Beka](http://www.abeka.com/) bought via donations that yielded state tax credits for the donors.
