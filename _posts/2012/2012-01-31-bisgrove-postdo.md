[Science Foundation Arizona](http://www.sfaz.org/) is sponsoring [a postdoctoral scholar program](http://graduate.asu.edu/bisgrove) at Arizona State University that offers a really sweet deal:

> Bisgrove Scholars will receive an annual stipend of $60,000, benefits and an additional $20,000 per year for research expenses. The Bisgrove appointment is renewable on a year-to-year basis for a maximum initial term of two years, contingent upon the availability of funds.

This program is only open to individuals who have no prior post-doctoral experience and obtain a PhD prior to appointment, i.e. doctoral students in their last year of studies.  So while you may be now eating ramen every night in the lab while trying to finish up the last experiment you need to graduate, this time next year, you could be eating ramen sprinkled with gold dust and angel tears, while trying to finish up the last experiment you need for a grant proposal.  (Did I mention that rent is cheap here?)

Another qualification is that your research has to fit with the Science Foundation Arizona's mission: "Areas include, diagnosis and prevention of disease, sustainable energy and the environment, and information and communications technologies at the human interface."

You will also need to specify possible mentors for your research project.  (Hey, I'm available!)

For instructions on how to apply, see http://graduate.asu.edu/bisgrove.

**Applications due Feb 15th.**
