And the [Center for Inquiry](http://www.centerforinquiry.net) provides a [short list of resources](http://www.centerforinquiry.net/oncampus/darwin_day) for campus organizations or anyone else who wants to sponsor an event. In particular, you may contact their [speakers bureau](http://www.centerforinquiry.net/speakers/category/evolution_creationism_and_intelligent_design) to find speakers on evolution, creationism, and intelligent-design creationism (it is a complete mystery why hardly anyone from Panda's Thumb is on that list, but we will not go into that now). Additionally, Center for Inquiry directs you to the [International Darwin Day Foundation](http://www.darwinday.org/), where you may find a list of activities near you, and, of course, the [National Center for Science Education](http://ncse.com/taking-action). 

CFI recommends that you try to teach someone about evolution or other scientific principles and notes that the Public Broadcasting System has a [wealth of material on evolution, science, and Darwin](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/index.html). The [Understanding Evolution](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/) Web page is likewise an excellent resource.

Finally, not mentioned by CFI, the Clergy Letter Project lists 400-odd [religious congregations](http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/rel_evolution_weekend_2012.htm) that plan Evolution Weekend activities, February 10-12. Indeed, it may be of interest to some that [Science can help church keep its young folk](http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=5259669&amp;ct=11563621).
