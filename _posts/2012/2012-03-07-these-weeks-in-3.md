<p>_Intelligent design news, commentary and discussion from the 20th of February to the 7th of March, 2012._</p>


<p>Semester 1 of my 3rd year of university started last week, so I've suddenly found myself with coursework to pore over. Likewise, the Discovery Institute seems to have kicked itself into a high gear, publishing a larger-than-average number of articles about numerous different topics, all of which just so happen to be rather important and weighty. Ah well, someone's got to cover them, my own studies of evolutionary genetics be damned.</p>


<p>This week I'll be looking at how the ID movement views the relationships between science, religion and politics, how it operates with respect to criticising evolutionary biology and supporting its own ideas, and how it deals with the "bad design" objection from critics of ID.</p>
