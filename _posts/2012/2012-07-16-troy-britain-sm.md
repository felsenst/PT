Troy Britain at [Playing Chess with Pigeons](http://pigeonchess.com/2012/07/16/fuzzy-thinking-about-fuzzy-dinosaurs/) flays a post by Casey Luskin about a recent paper on proto-feathers on dinosaur fossils. Britain shows how Luskin doctors a quotation by replacing a comma with a period, uses strategic ellipses in quotations to conceal relevant context, and in the end questions the common descent of dinosaurs.  Yup, that means that Luskin really did imply something like the separate creation of ornithischians, saurischians, and theropods, three major clades of dinosaurs.

In other news, dog bites man.
