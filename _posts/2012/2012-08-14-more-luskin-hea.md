As we all know, the new book from the Disco 'Tute, _Science and Human Origins_, has taken a considerable amount of flak for various and sundry flaws. Paul McBride has a chapter-by-chapter review [starting here](http://apomorph.blogspot.com/2012/06/science-and-human-origins-chapter-1.html). Amusing among the critiques was Carl Zimmer's quest to get a reference from the authors for a specific claim, summarized [here](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/07/23/and-finally-the-hounding-duck-can-rest/). Nick Matzke posted an equally amusing account of a Facebook exchange with (presumably) the authors [in a thumb comment](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/07/fun-on-facebook.html#comment-288916). The Disco Tute authors ended that exchange by closing comments on the thread, running for a venue that doesn't allow comments.

Now [Afarensis has dissected another claim](http://afarensis99.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/luskin-science-and-human-origins-and-dik-dik-feces/) made in an excerpt from the paleo chapter by Luskin (who is a lawyer writing on paleo) about what Luskin calls [Later Hominins: The Australopithecine Gap](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2012/08/later_hominins_062891.html), I strongly recommend Afarensis' takedown to our readers. I particularly call attention to Afarensis' analysis of Luskin's quote-mining and misrepresentations about Lucy. Is anyone surprised?
