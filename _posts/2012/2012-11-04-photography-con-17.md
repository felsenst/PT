Congratulations to Lou Jost, who has won both the [Lab Rats](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/10/photo-contest-l.html) and [General](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/10/photo-contest-f.html) categories, with his photographs, Orchids and Volcan Tungurahua. 

On the theory that Mr. Jost does not need two copies of [Among the Creationists: Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line](http://www.amazon.com/Among-Creationists-Dispatches-Anti-Evolutionist-Front/dp/0199744637), by Jason Rosenhouse, we declare James Kocher the third-place winner for his photograph Banded Iron Formation, in the Lab Rats category, and award Mr. Kocher the second copy of Mr. Rosenhouse's book.
