The physics community is all a-twitter (figuratively _and_ literally) over the announcement today from CERN that two independent teams have detected a particle that has properties consistent with those hypothesized for the Higgs boson, the particle that gives matter mass. Ethan at [Starts With a Bang](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/) has some background [here](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/03/the-biggest-firework-of-them-all-the-higgs/) and has set up a trap for stories on it [here](http://trap.it/#!traps/id/11a80242-6298-4e24-bae6-80e383cb92e8).

What caught my eye today, though, was a [Reuters story](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/us-science-higgs-idUSBRE86008K20120704) on the discovery. In it we read

> \[The Higgs boson\] is the last undiscovered piece of the Standard Model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. The model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists.

Lovely!
