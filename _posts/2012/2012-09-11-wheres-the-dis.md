The [Sensuous Curmudgeon](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/discovery-institute-their-2010-tax-return/) has obtained the [Disco 'Tute's Form 990](http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/911/911521697/911521697_201012_990.pdf) for 2010. There are several interesting aspects of it, but I'll mention just one. (See the linked post for more.) In the breakdown of funds, roughly $3m--75%--of the DI's total budget was devoted to the Center for ~~the Renewal of~~ Science and Culture. However, just $220K, 7.3% of the CSC's total, was devoted to actual scientific research (assuming that the BioLogic Institute does actual scientific research). Undoubtedly that number has grown since 2010, but I would be surprised to see it  approach even a quarter of CSC's revenue. Kind of sad for a purportedly scientific enterprise.
