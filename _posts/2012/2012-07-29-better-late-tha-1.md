<big>In 1999 I posted to the Talk Reason website a critical review of Professor Nathan Aviezer's book _In the Beginning_ \[1\] and of his article _The Anthropic Principle_ published in the Jewish Action journal \[2\]. My review was titled _The End of the Beginning_ (see [here](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/aviezer.cfm).) \[3\]. Soon afterward one of my friends (on his own initiative) sent a copy of that essay to Aviezer and asked him to respond.  Professor Aviezer chose to ignore my friend's request.  Of course, Professor Aviezer was under no obligation to respond to critique. In the following years my essay evoked some discussion on the internet, but Professor Aviezer remained silent in regard to my critique. In 2003 my book _Unintelligent Design_\[4\] was published, wherein one chapter was a slightly modified and updated version of my essay in question. Professor Aviezer remained unresponsive to my critique.  Suddenly, in February 2012, 13 years after my review of his work appeared, Professor Aviezer posted a reply (see torahmusings.com/2012/02/fossils-and-faith ) \[5\].</big>
