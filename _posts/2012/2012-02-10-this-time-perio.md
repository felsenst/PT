<p>_Intelligent design news, commentary and discussion from the 17th of December, 2011 to the 10th of February, 2012._</p>


<p>Huh? Intelligent design, what's that? Oh, oh, yes. Yes, you're quite right. I'm sorry, I've been out of the loop a bit and I'd forgotten this little movement I like to keep an eye on from time to time. Well, it's actually supposed to be a weekly thing, but... things have been crazy around here. Leave me alone, I'm a university student on holidays, I have no time to do anything.</p>


<p>Anyway, what has the intelligent design community been up to online since we last saw them? Not a **huge**Â amount, actually, although certainly more stuff than is feasibly possible to fit into one blog post. So, like normal, I'll skim off the cream floating at the top of this ID think-tank and have a peer into the beaker I used to do it.</p>


<p>This time we'll be looking at speciation, the glowing past and future of ID, ID as a default assumption in science, appeals to historical authority, and the Discovery Institute distancing themselves from a creationist bill in Indiana.</p>
