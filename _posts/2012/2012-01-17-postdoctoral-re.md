The Cartwright Lab at Arizona State University is seeking Postdoctoral
Research Associates in the area of Computational Evolutionary Genetics
(broadly defined).  The Cartwright Lab is part of The Center for
Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics (CEMI), one of 10 research
centers in the Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute.

Research in the Cartwright Lab covers many different questions in
population genetics and molecular evolution, at the interface of
biology, statistics, and computer science.  A majority of our research
involves developing, implementing, and applying novel methodologies to
study genomic datasets.  Potential research topics for postdoctoral
research associates include


* The study of mutation patterns between human families and across
species, using data from next-generation sequencing.  This includes
both indel and point-mutation patterns.
* Models of frequency-dependent selection, with applications to genomic data.
* New methods for alignment and phylogeny reconstruction that take
into account the uncertainty of genomic data.
* New methods for simulating homologous sequences that can be
optimized to mimic natural datasets.
