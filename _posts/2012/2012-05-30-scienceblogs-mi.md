As most here know, ScienceBlogs has moved to National Geographic (well, not literally moved, but is now somehow affiliated with NatGeo), and also just migrated to WordPress. That has caused some problems. One problem I found today was that Google Reader no longer recognizes new posts on Jason Rosenhouse's [EvolutionBlog](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/). I had to resubscribe in the reader to get the new posts. 

The problem appears to be general across ScienceBlogs--it's the same in [Aardvarchaeology](http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/) and [Greg Laden's Blog](http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/).

Commenting is still screwed up over there, too, and they are aware of it. But to get new ScienceBlogs posts it looks like you'll have to resubscribe in Google Reader.
