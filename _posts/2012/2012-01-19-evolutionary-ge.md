My high school, [Athens Academy](http://www.athensacademy.org/) in Athens, GA, is currently offering an Evolutionary Genetics course to 11th graders (16--17 year olds).  They are mostly using an curriculum from the [University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu) funded through a grant for K-12 evolutionary education development.
