Bjørn Østman at [Pleiotropy](http://pleiotropy.fieldofscience.com/2012/10/pleiotropy-saves-day-for-evolving-new.html) describes new research in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/384.abstract) that shows how duplicated genes can evolve to perform new functions. It presents 

> ... a new model/mechanism by which duplicated genes can retain the selection pressure to not succumb to deleterious mutations. They call it the innovation-amplification-divergene model (IAD).

Basically, 

> IAD works like this: A gene initially has one function only (A). Then some genetic changes makes it also have a new function, b, which at first is not of too great importance. Then some environmental change favors the gene variants with the minor b-function (the innovation stage). This is then followed by duplication of the gene, such that there are now more than one copy that carries out A and b (the amplification stage). At this stage there is selection for more b, and at some point genetic changes in one of the copies results in a gene that is better at the new function, B. At this point, selection for the genes that do both A and b is relaxed, because the new gene (blue) carries out the new function. The original gene then loses the b function, and we are left with two distinct genes. 

Michael Behe, of course, [scoffs](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2012/11/to_traverse_a_m_1066201.html). Because the researchers did some manipulations that created conditions favorable to the evolution of the new function, Behe claims that 

> Needless to say, this ain't how unaided nature works -- unless nature is guiding events toward a goal.

  Shucks. I guess every experimental manipulation ever performed has been an invalid method of studying some process. But as a PT crew member pointed out on the back channel, "this kind of shit happens all the time in nature." See, for example, [Gene duplication and the adaptive evolution of a classic genetic switch](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928853) or [Escape from adaptive conflict after duplication in an anthocyanin pathway gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18594508).
