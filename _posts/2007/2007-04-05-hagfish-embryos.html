<p class="lead">I've been looking forward to seeing these little jewels in print since I saw <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/how_i_spent_my_morning_at_sicb.php">Kuratani talk about them at the SICB meetings</a> in January. Hagfish are wonderfully slimy jawless chordates that have been difficult to raise in the lab&mdash;although if you poke a whale corpse rotting in the cold deeps you'll find them swarming everywhere. The Kuratani lab has managed to keep animals of the species <i>Eptatretus burgeri</i> alive and healthy in a lab aquarium maintained at cold temperatures (16&deg;C), and has even had success in breeding them. That object to the right is a single hagfish egg, brown and leathery-shelled and surprisingly <i>big</i>&mdash;it's an inch and a half long!</p>

<p>They collected 92 eggs, and then another limitation emerged: it took 5-7 <i>months</i> for embryos to develop in a small number of the eggs. Hagfish aren't going to be your typical fast-developing model system, I'm afraid, but they are extraordinarily cool animals, and it's good to see work beginning on them.</p>
