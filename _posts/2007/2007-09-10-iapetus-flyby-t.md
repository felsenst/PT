<img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/moons/images/Iapetus_PIA06166-240x240.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />What with graduate school and all, I almost forgot about the thing I have been anticipating for months -- the [Cassini spacecraft](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm)'s [superclose flyby of Iapetus](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/events/iapetus/index.cfm).  It's happening right now apparently.   So finally we might find out whether or not that crazy equatorial ring really is a spaceship runway like the UFOologists say. I mean, obviously a perfectly straight line of mountains on the equator can't be explained by natural regularities or random chance, so it's got to be ID, right?  And of course the [creos will say](http://creationsafaris.com/crev200709.htm#20070907a) that whatever they find is evidence for a young universe.
