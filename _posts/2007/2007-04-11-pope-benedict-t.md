This [news article](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070411/sc_nm/pope_evolution_dc;_ylt=A0WTcVuOvBxGkYYADgrMWM0F) reports on a topic that tugs at antievolutionist heartstrings: would the Pope, leader of the Catholic church, throw in with them, joining them in the "intelligent design" big tent? The answer, at least according to this news report, is "No". Pope Benedict is reported to adopt theistic evolution, the idea that God's method of creation is what science has discovered concerning evolutionary biology. And we know from William Dembski that "intelligent design theorists" are no friends of theistic evolution.

A lot of the coverage has concentrated on Benedict's stance against atheism, which seems to me to be about as newsworthy as taking up the question, "Is the Pope Catholic?" Well, yes, it seems that he is.
