On Pharyngula, PZ provides a comment [response](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/avalos_responds.php) by Hector Avalos

> The Discovery Institute has mounted the latest in a long string of creationist smear campaigns against me in Iowa. While I have never called for Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez to be fired, or even to be denied tenure, there are plenty of creationists who blatantly direct our university to fire me.

After all the Discovery Institute had decided to attack Avalos based on some [pretty poor logic. ](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/05/iowa_state_promotes_atheist_pr.html#more)

Determined not to be outdone by his fellows at the Discovery Institute, Dembski [responds as well](http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/and-hector-avalos-deserves-tenure-at-isu/)

Noticable quote:

> Third, if Avalos has fudged on the status of this article---and has done so in a very public way---his CV may loaded with this type of fluff. Perhaps it's time to start hunting for the real witch.

How are these kinds of 'arguments' going to help their fellow IDist Guillermo Gonzalez?

Fascinating... ID under pressure actually inflates...

As a final sign of despair, the Discovery Institute has dusted off its Egnor bot.
