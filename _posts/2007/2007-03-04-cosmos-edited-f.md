I have another observation in pop culture's war on ignorance.  (Okay, that is an oxymoron.)

On tonight's [Family Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy), "[Airpot '07](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_%2707)", Peter attends "The Redneck Comedy Tour" and decides that he wants to become a redneck.  So he buys a pick-up truck, puts the couch on the front lawn, and hits on his daughter.  Then he sits down with Brian to watch [Carl Sagan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) [Cosmos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage).

Scientists believe its four b---hundreds and hundreds of years old---Scientists have determined that the universe was created by a---Goooooooood---Big Bang.  If you look at the bones of a---Jesus--asaurus rex, it is clear by the use of carbon dating that---Mountain Dew is the best soda ever made.

Of course, carbon dating cannot be used on the fossils of a "Jesusasaurus rex"; other forms of radiometric dating with longer half-lifes have to be used.

**Update:** Below the fold, I've posted the scene from YouTube.  Thanks Chris Hyland.
