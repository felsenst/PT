Over at the Discovery Institute's blog, Casey Luskin <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/07/msnbc_promotes_darwinian_justs.html#more">thinks he's caught</a> evolutionists wanting it both ways:

<blockquote>
<b>Question</b>: What do you do when a theory logically predicts both (a) and not (a)?
Answer: Apparently you heavily promote it.

<b>MSNBC</b> recently published two articles promoting Darwinian just-so stories to the public. The first article about the evolution of Waterfowl genitalia contends, &ldquo;Scientists had speculated that male waterfowl evolved longer phalluses to give them a competitive edge over those not as well-endowed when it came to successfully fertilizing females.&rdquo; That makes sense, I suppose. But the article makes one admission that strikingly contradicts that little just-so hypothesis: &ldquo;Most birds lack phalluses, organs like human penises. Waterfowl are among the just 3 percent of all living bird species that retain the grooved phallus...&rdquo; If long phalluses are so advantageous for reproduction, why did so many birds supposedly lose them? Darwinists will look back retroactively and claim that under the environmental conditions or sexual selection pressures experienced by most bird species, long phalluses weren't advantageous. The problem in so doing is that they now have a theory which can explain both (a) long phalluses, and also not (a).
