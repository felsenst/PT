[Just in from the _New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/education/19board.html): 

> The National Association of State Boards of Education \[NASBE\] will elect officers in July, and for one office, president-elect, there is only one candidate: a member of the Kansas school board who supported its efforts against the teaching of evolution.

Who would that be?  [Ken Willard, someone you may remember](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2006-36%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=Ken+Willard%2C+kansas%2C+creationism&amp;btnG=Search).
