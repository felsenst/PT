In South Carolina, things were mostly quiet after last year's election and defeat of [creationist](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/11/five-reasons-not-to-vote-for-karen.html) [candidate](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/11/critical-analys-1.html) for state superintendent of education Karen Floyd, and the [defeat](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/06/discovery-insti-5.html) of the pro-creationism language that the Discovery Institute tried to worm into the curriculum standards.

But you knew they wouldn't give up.  Now a young-earth creationist named [Kristin Maguire](http://notverybright.wordpress.com/2007/12/15/who-is-kristin-maguire/) has been elected as the chairperson of the State Board of Education.  Her qualifications?  She home-schooled her four children.  And that's it. 

The South Carolinians for Science Education blog has more on this, both about [Maguire's election](http://www.sc-scied.org/EE/index.php/scied/comments/kristen_maguire_elected_to_chair_sbe_in_2009/) and about a new assault on the [textbook selection process](http://www.sc-scied.org/EE/index.php/scied/comments/creationists_corrupt_textbook_selection_in_south_carolina/).  Best stock up on the headache medicine now.  It's going to be a long 2008.
