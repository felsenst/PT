There are a number of Darwin Day events going on in the Palmetto State, both today and throughout the week.  You can go to the [South Carolinians for Science Education](http://www.sc-scied.org/EE/index.php) website for a complete run-down of the events and links to the individual flyers.  Events will be held at [Furman](http://www.sc-scied.org/EE/index.php/scied/comments/darwin_day_celebration_at_furman_university/), the [College of Charleston](http://www.cofc.edu/%7Edillonr/DarwinWeekVII.html), and [Clemson](http://www.thewilsonshouse.com/science/SCSE/CUDarwinDay07.doc).  Kenneth Miller will also be [speaking](http://www.thewilsonshouse.com/science/SCSE/KenMilleratCU.doc) in Clemson next Monday.
