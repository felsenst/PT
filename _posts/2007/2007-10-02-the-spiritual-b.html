<p class="lead">I tried. I really, honestly, sincerely tried. I've been struggling with this book, <i>The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul</i><sup><span style="font-size: 9px;">(<a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060858834/pharyngula-20" target="_new" title="buy this book at amazon">amzn</a>/<a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;bfpid=0060858834&amp;bfmtype=book" target="_new" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;noble">b&amp;n</a>/<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0060858834&cm_ven=CJ&amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" target="_new" title="buy this book at abebooks">abe</a>/<a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn=0060858834" target="_new" title="buy this book at Powells">pwll</a>)</span></sup>, by Mario Beauregard and Denyse O'Leary, for the past week and a half, and I've finally decided it's not worth the effort. It's just about completely unreadable.</p>

<p>This is not a positive review by any stretch of the imagination, I'm afraid &mdash; it's a very poorly written book, which reaches unsupportable conclusions by ridiculous contortions of logic.
