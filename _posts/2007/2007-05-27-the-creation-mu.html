<p>The long-gestating and expensive monument to creationism's folly, the Creation "Museum" of Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis, is having its grand opening tomorrow. We've collected the blogosphere-wide reaction to this amazingly inane edifice at Pharyngula, in an article called simply <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/the_creation_museum.php">The Creation Museum</a>.</p>

<p>We do not take a conciliatory or encouraging view to this development.</p>
