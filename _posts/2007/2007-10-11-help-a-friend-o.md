Shelley Batts, the promising young scientist behind the [Retrospectacle](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/) blog and a friend of the Panda's Thumb, is up for a $10,000 blogging scholarship. She's currently in 2nd place, but is 1000 votes behind first place. So let's all get behind her and push her to a victory. You'll be helping a brilliant young neuroscientist do what all scholars need to do - pay off their student loans! Click on the button below and cast your vote.
