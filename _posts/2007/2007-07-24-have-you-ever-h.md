The Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, William Dembski's current employer, has something rather curious on its website. If you look at their page of [upcoming conferences](http://www.swbts.edu/index.cfm?pageid=579), here is what they have listed in the left-hand sidebar:

> * The Practice of Biblical Counseling
> * Certification in Biblical Counseling
> * The Family: Reclaiming a Biblical View
> * Intelligent Design in Business Practice

Can you spot the one that appears out of place?  Me neither.

But anyway, yes, they really are having a conference called, [Intelligent Design in Business Practice](http://www.swbts.edu/index.cfm?pageid=920).  The flier for the conference comes complete with an obligatory ape-typing-at-keyboard graphic.  Unfortunately, it does not say which of the speakers this is intended to represent.

If you're wondering what the heck ID could have to do with business practice, when it doesn't even have anything to do with science, then you're thinking what I'm thinking.  All the pretense about ID being some dispassionate scientific theory -- not exactly believable to begin with --  is rather hard to maintain with them holding conferences that try to apply ID to things that have little or nothing to do with science.  (Not to mention that even their supposedly "scientific" conferences tend to resemble [tent revivals](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/03/darwin_and_design_in_knoxville.php#more).)  As the [Wedge Document](http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html) has promised us, ID is supposed to have "cultural implications" for "sex, gender issues, medicine, law, and religion".  Business isn't listed there, but once you've declared that your theory makes sweeping dictates over all facets of human society, it's hardly a stretch to add business practices to the list.   

Nevertheless, one has to wonder, given the history of the ID movement, exactly what useful advice the ID movement could possibly have to offer business.  As luck would have it, I've gotten my hands on a preliminary schedule -- the only copy in existence as a matter of fact -- which I will post below the fold.
