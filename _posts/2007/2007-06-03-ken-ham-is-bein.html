<p class="lead">What a delightful and well deserved development! The Australian sister organization to Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis <a title="Biblical battle of creation groups | The Nation | The Australian" href="http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21843706-2702,00.html?from=public_rss">is hammering him with a nasty lawsuit</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Brisbane-based Creation Ministries International has filed a lawsuit in Queensland's Supreme Court against Mr Ham and his Kentucky-based Answers in Genesis ministry seeking damages and accusing him of deceptive conduct in his dealings with the Australian organisation. </p>
<p>The suit focuses on a dispute over the Australian organisation's production of a creationist magazine, sold in the US to more than 35,000 subscribers, and has led to revelations about the three-year battle between the two ministries. </p>
<p>A 40-page report, written by Mr Briese and obtained by The Australian, reveals a bitter power struggle across the Pacific that began with a challenge to the power Mr Ham allegedly wielded over the ministries.</p></blockquote>
<p>I honestly don't care who wins. The ideal conclusion will be that of the  Kilkenny cats: mutual self-destruction.</p>
