Just a reminder that there will be a symposium this weekend discussing evolution and intelligent design at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa (and featuring PT-er Wes Elsberry).  The event is geared toward those interested in matters of faith or science; teachers; principals; college students majoring in education, science and religion/philosophy; clergy; and parish educators.  Scholarships are available for the first 200 K-12 educators, board of education members, school administrators, etc. who apply--still plenty of those left, so if you know anyone who'd be interested, point them in our direction.  I'm including the text of one press release below the jump; all the information (including registration and hotel) can be found at [the symposium website.](http://www.iowa-rsd.org)
