There was a <a href="http://www.thewhitepath.com/archives/2007/03/turkeys_first_id_conferenceaccomplished.php">pro-ID confab</a> in Istanbul last week.  Among the speakers was mathematician David Berlinski, whose boneheaded essays appear in <i>Commentary</i> with depressing regularity.  A brief abstract of his talk is posted at the conference website, and it stresses five main points that he regards as fatal to Darwinian theory.  Over at EvolutionBlog I have <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/03/berlinski_in_turkey.php">posted a few thoughts</a> in reply.  Comments can be left there.  Enjoy!
