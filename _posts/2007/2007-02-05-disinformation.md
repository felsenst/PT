I always enjoy watching creationists blather about stuff that they have no knowledge about, which is of course just about anything that comes out of their mouths.  I am always amazed how they can pull the most randomly backwards arguments from out of nowhere and confidently state that this one is the one that is going to trump "Darwinism".  Their arguments are really not that different from one another, but they sure can come up with some bizarre and senseless variations.

[Good Math, Bad Math](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/) has a good take down of one such recent argument from Cordova on UD: [Once again, Sal and Friends Butcher Information Theory](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/02/once_again_sal_and_friends_but.php).
