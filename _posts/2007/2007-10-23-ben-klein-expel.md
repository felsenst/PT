On October 22, Anika Smith, posted the following announcement on EvolutionNews.org

> Ben Stein, star of the new movie "Expelled," is going to be on the O'Reilly Factor tonight, talking about his involvement in "Expelled" and the suppression that's taking place in our nation's academic and scientific communities. Be sure to tune in and learn more about the movie, which we first noted here. 

After Ben ~~Kl~~Stein's disastrous appearance in which both he and the host emphasized the religious foundation of Intelligent Design, the posting seems to have been expelled from the website. But [evidence remains](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/10/ben_stein_on_oreilly_factor.html)

Teach the controversy seems to have its limits. But design inferences are fun.
