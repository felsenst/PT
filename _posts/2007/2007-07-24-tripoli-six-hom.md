It's over in Libya.  Nick previously blogged about [the Tripoli Six](/archives/2006/12/libya-vs-evolut.html):  a Palestinian doctor and five Bulgarian nurses, working in Libya, who were accused of infecting hundreds of children with HIV.  The group have been imprisoned since 1999--despite the fact that an analysis of the HIV isolates from the children confirmed that the epidemic began before the medical workers arrived in the country (and continued even after they were jailed).  After a long battle, mostly legal and political rather than scientific, they've been [freed and sent back to Bulgaria.](http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2007/07/tripoli_6_free_at_last.php)  More on the story at [the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6912965.stm) and [the New York Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-Bulgaria-Libya.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin)  

I should note that though the science ultimately wasn't the determining factor in their release, the science blogosphere and _Nature_ (with journalist/blogger [Declan Butler](http://declanbutler.info/blog/) leading the charge) were important in keeping this prominent in the scientific community.  And while we celebrate their freedom, there are still hundreds of HIV-infected children in Libya, and grieving parents who missed out on justice in this case.
