Just when you believe that ID activists could not shoot themselves in the foot any further, Casey Luskin comes to the rescue, and Dembski decides to add some fuel to the smoldering fire. So what is going on this time that ticked of our friends at the Ministry of Media Complaints at the Discovery Institute's Center for ~~the Renewal of~~ Science and Religion? At [Red State Rabble](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2007/03/dembskis-diagnosis-or-seventh-most.html), Pat Hayes and at  the [Austringer](http://austringer.net/wp/?p=522) Wesley Elsberry explain Casey Luskin's misplaced 'outrage' and show how once again, poor reading and listening skills (see also my previous posting about Dembski mangling Darwin) allow ID activists to create yet another strawman.

While ID is busy with their theological arguments, science is still waiting patiently for ID to present a scientific case ever since ID was found and ruled to be scientifically vacuous.

Enjoy.
