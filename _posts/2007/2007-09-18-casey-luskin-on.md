Remember that Dembski and others have admitted that processes of variation and selection (chance and regularity) can in fact increase the information content of the genome. As such, it seems that [whether or not Dawkins can explain](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/09/richard_dawkins_on_the_origin.html) the origin of information, seem irrelevant. However, as Ridlon shows, Dawkins indeed attempted to explain the origin of information in the genome. I invite Casey Luskin, or other ID proponents, to explain why they believe Dawkins' explanation is flawed. In addition, I invite them to either admit or deny that Dembski and others have dropped the flawed argument that processes of regularity and chance cannot create information in the genome?

Evolution News & Views presents analysis of that coverage, as well as original reporting that accurately delivers information about the current state of the debate over Darwinian evolution."

This is a prime example of "sloppy, inaccurate, and in some cases, overtly biased". A quick google search of "Dawkins and Information" would have been enough research to have discovered Dawkins response.

He also doesn't admit that Dawkins answered the question (Luskin says: Read Dawkins' response at http://www.skeptics.com.au/articles/dawkins.htm and see if he still has yet to satisfactorily answer the question!).

> Now that Luskin admits that Dawkins answers the "Information Challenge", I think someone on Panda's Thumb should challenge Luskin, who says, "Read Dawkins' response ... and see if he still has yet to satisfactorily answer the question!", to show where Dawkins is wrong. Don't let him off the hook here.
