Taner Edis (author of _An Illusion of Harmony: Science and Religion in Islam_, Prometheus Books, 2007), writes in an essay about the sitiuation with intelligent design _vs._ evolution in Muslim countries:

"_Muslim populations have not been very hospitable to Darwinian evolution, supporting some of the most successful versions of creationism in the world. Lately, some Muslim intellectuals have been showing interest in intelligent design as well._" 

Taner Edis argues that this is a mistake, and that enthusiasm for intelligent design can only harm the already weak state of science in Muslim lands.
