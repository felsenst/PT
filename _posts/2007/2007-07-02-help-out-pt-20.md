As some of you may know, I'm working on a new layout for the Panda's Thumb and updating our backend at the same time.  I've decided that this might be a good opportunity to delegate my work load to other experienced programmers.

I have a list of several projects that I'd like to complete before the role out of PT 2.0.  So if you are interested in helping, send me a email at <a href="mailto:QVQ00GEk4Ew:1F8771oM3ol17FI+">reed@pandasthumb.org</a>.  I am looking for people who have lots of experience with Perl, MoveableType, MySQL, PostgreSQL, AJAX, JSON, Prototype, and/or Javascript.
