Few things are more ironic than young-earth creationist John Mark Reynolds (theologian at Biola, Discovery Institute fellow, leader in the ID movement) [lecturing scientists about truth, stubborn facts, and having an "open philosophy of science."](http://www.scriptoriumdaily.com/2007/04/09/some-basics-on-design-creation-and-other-such-matters-i/)  If there's an earthquake in LA today, it won't be the tectonic plates shifting, it will be the simultaneous detonation of thousands of irony meters.  How does the man get up in morning, when [young-earth creationism is as hopelessly false on the empirical facts](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html#CD) as anything ever has been in the whole history of science, and when the fundamentalist movement's promotion of young-earth creationism is perhaps the biggest example of systematic fraud ever perpetrated on the American public?  If you ever need an example of an ID advocate blathering lip service about "truth", while shamelessly disregarding it in practice at the exact same time, here you go.
