Jacob Bronowski used to say that the greatest discovery of scientists was science itself. The scientific method, with its resolute search for causation, its refusal to cower before tradition and authoritarianism was responsible for the great advancement of humanity over the past centuries. Obviously scientists have not always lived up to these standards, but those who have took man to places he could only have imagined before (and not even imagined very well). Central to this accomplishment is science's refusal to be satisfied with magical explanations of phenomena. Magic, after all, is not an answer---it's the feeling of satisfaction without answers. It's the willingness to tolerate a big blank spot in one's understanding of the universe.
