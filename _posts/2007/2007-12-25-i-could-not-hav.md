Indeed, the [scientist](http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/) provides testable predictions and hypotheses while the information theoretician is complaining at the lack of details while failing to explain how Intelligent Design explains the evolution of fish.

Of course, the gap approach by ID proponents was predicted by [PZ Myers](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/tiktaalik_makes_another_gap.php)

So what has ID done for science when it  comes to understanding Tiktaalik and other fossils? Nothing, and the fantastic reality is that when scientists come up with scientific hypotheses, ID remains fully irrelevant and unable to contribute its scientific hypotheses or provide the necessary probabilistic calculations which are necessary to 'infer design'.

This was indeed an unexpected Christmas present from O'Leary.
