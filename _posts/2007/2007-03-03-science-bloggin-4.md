John Dupuis at [Confessions of a Science Librarian](http://jdupuis.blogspot.com/) [has good things to say about The Open Laboratory (2006)](http://jdupuis2.blogspot.com/2007/03/gawande-atul-editor-jesse-cohen-series.html).

> At first glance it seems that \[Bora\] Zivkovic set himself an impossible task trying to pull something decent together, both in terms of the presentation and the quality of the content, in such a short period of time. We can probably only expect something shoddy and half-assed---right? Well, I'm happy to say that all fears of disaster were certainly not justified---anyone that pays attention to Zivkovic's blog knows that he's smart, capable, dedicated and without a doubt energetcic and that he wouldn't let something unworthy out the door.

This review is just in time for [Bora's announcement](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/announcement_get_ready_for_the.php) that we are now taking [submissions](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/) for the 2007 anthology.  Unlike last year, we will begin to compile a list of worthy posts in March instead of at the last minute in December.  Any original blog entry made between 12-20-06 and 12-20-07 is eligible.

If you want to spread the word, I have put together a badge that you can use to link to the submission form.

Also for all you 2006 winners, I have made a badge honoring your achievement.  Go ahead, place it on your blog so everyone can know how great of a science blogger you are.  Note that you can see a demo over in our sidebar.

[You can find html code for the badges on my blog.](http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2007/03/openlab_2007.html)
