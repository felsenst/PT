Hi all,

Last weekend I meet a few friends for lunch in Raleigh's Cameron Village.  We had a great time sitting out side drinking coffee and eating sandwiches.  I really want to do it again, both in Raleigh and other great towns.  On that note, I'll be tagging along with [Evolgen's RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/) to the [Fly Conference in Philadelphia next week](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/03/once_a_blogger_soon_to_be_a_bl.php).  If any of my fans will be at the conference or just in the area, [go drop RPM a line](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/03/once_a_blogger_soon_to_be_a_bl.php) and see if we can meet up for cheese steaks and bamboo beer.

Now for some pictures of the Raleigh meetup.  \[Note: You can find many of my pictures in [my gallery](http://scit.us/gallery2/v/stevesteve/), including ones from the Science Blogging Conference, where many people were begging me for photos.\]

<figcaption markdown="span">Katie's dress was very fetching, even if a little revealing.  Of course, I was shocked that she so flagrantly flashed her knickers about, but was assured that it is an Australian tradition.  Then Katie pointed that I was wearing nothing but a bow tie, saying something about the Chip 'n' Dale chipmunks.  She lent me her dress insisting that I be more modest than she was.
