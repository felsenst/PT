A couple of weeks ago, I [posted](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/09/todays_bob_jones_biology_for_c.php) two ridiculous quotes that are found in the [Bob Jones textbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0890845786%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0890845786%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) that's involved in the California Creationism lawsuit. I'm still wading through these texts and [Behe's report](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/09/behe_and_the_california_creati.php) explaining why it's really a very good book for high school students to use to learn biology. It's a slow process, and a painful one, but I've found another couple of outstanding quotes to share with you.
</p>

<p>
This time, I'm including three different types of quote. There are a couple where the authors say things have absolutely nothing to do with science of any kind (and are totally out to lunch even by the standards of a lot of religious people I know). There's one where the book takes a brief detour into right-wingnuttery. I've also got one quote that I'm including as a special treat for those of you who might still want to claim that the book's fine if you just overlook the insane religious stuff - an example of a case where the authors manage to mangle a very basic concept from genetics. 
</p>

<p>
We'll start with the insane, and move from there to the political, then conclude with the merely wrong.
