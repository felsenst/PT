<img src="http://media.npr.org/programs/watc/features/2007/may/carl_linneaus200.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />Today is the 300th birthday of [Linnaeus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus), aka Carl Linnaeus, Carolus Linnaeus, Carl von LinnÃ©, Carl LinnÃ©, etc. etc.  Oh, heck, just call him Carl. Happy birthday, Carl!  [NPR reports](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10285885) that more than 600 birthday parties/science education events are going on around the planet this week -- none bigger than in Sweden:

> This month marks the 300th birthday of Carl Linnaeus, Sweden's beloved botanist who gave order to the plant and animal kingdoms.
> 
> The Swedes will celebrate on Wednesday with a jubilee in Uppsala, complete with Linnaeus cream cakes.

And well they should, "[Carl Linnaeus is by far the most internationally well-known Swede that has ever lived](http://www.linnaeus2007.se/carllinnaeus.4.44d172dc10f76d2e37e80008608.html)"!

Break out the meatballs while you're at it!  The NPR story also goes a bit into how DNA and the proliferation of ranks are continually changing Linnaeus's system.  

Sadly, there is nothing in the story about [Hennig and cladistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennig) -- Hennig's 100th is coming up in 2013 -- but even if rank-free taxonomy completely takes over eventually, I bet Linnaeus will still cast enough of a shadow to get some birthday parties in 2107.
