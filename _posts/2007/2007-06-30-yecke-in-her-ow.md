There has been controversy over a particular quote of Cheri Pierson Yecke. The Princeton (MN) Union-Eagle reported on October 9th, 2003 that Yecke had said local schools districts could teach "intelligent design". I copied that quote in a [post on my blog on August 30, 2005](http://austringer.net/wp/?p=141). A couple of weeks ago, I received an email from ReputationDefenders on Yecke's behalf asking for removal of the quote on the grounds that it was false.

Several Minnesotans have said that the position noted by the Princeton Union-Eagle was, in fact, accurate. Over on Greg Laden's [blog](http://gregladen.com/wordpress/?p=1024), "Cat's Staff" [noted](http://gregladen.com/wordpress/?p=1024#comment-47876) that a Minnesota TV station had [video of Yecke](http://video1.tpt.org:8080/ramgen/almanac/show/1852.rm?start=8:23) discussing the science standards. I viewed it, then transcribed the relevant part. As far as I am concerned, the Princeton Union-Eagle is vindicated in this matter; at the time that they reported, Cheri Pierson Yecke was indeed saying that teaching "intelligent design" was a decision that local school districts could undertake. Both the quote from the Princeton Union-Eagle and the subsequent criticism I made of Yecke's position on the issue are upheld by this source.

> The issue really is intelligent design and evolution and the there was language that was put in the conference committee report that accompanied the no child left behind act that said you know students should be exposed to all sides of a controversial issue. \[...\] And it is well understood now that this is a decision that would be made by local school boards and not the state.
