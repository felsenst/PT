I'm sure you've seen the posts [here at Panda's Thumb](http://www.google.com/custom?cof=S%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.pandasthumb.org%3BGL%3A0%3BAH%3Acenter%3BAWFID%3A38e0a0f7f4d5f984%3B&amp;domains=pandasthumb.org&amp;sitesearch=pandasthumb.org&amp;q=egnor&amp;sa=Search) or over at [Scienceblogs](http://scienceblogs.com/sample/fastsearch?order=date&amp;IncludeBlogs=49%2C83%2C3%2C11%2C8%2C55%2C64%2C10%2C87%2C60%2C22%2C80%2C15%2C78%2C52%2C4%2C48%2C45%2C63%2C14%2C25%2C53%2C69%2C50%2C42%2C89%2C5%2C47%2C90%2C71%2C9%2C62%2C16%2C38%2C67%2C43%2C73%2C81%2C44%2C79%2C23%2C7%2C41%2C46%2C17%2C61%2C82%2C54%2C74%2C85%2C70%2C21%2C12%2C65%2C86%2C75%2C72%2C6%2C91%2C51%2C&amp;search=egnor&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) about the Discovery Institute's newest protÃ©gÃ©, [Dr. Michael Egnor.](http://www.upsb.org/xq/asp/code.966/qx/html_patient/physician.htm)  A professor of neurosurgery at SUNY-Stony Brook, Dr. Egnor has been pontificating on how "Darwinism" has nothing to offer to medicine; and indeed, that evolutionary biology has "hijacked" other fields of study.  Mike has [already aptly pointed out](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/03/an_everdeepening_egnorance.php) many of Egnor's strawmen and intellectual dishonesties, so I won't review them all.  I've stayed out of the fray until now  because I've had limited time and others have been handling it quite ably, but he keeps [treading into (and butchering) my territory](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/darwinist_sleightofthumb.html), so I just wanted to point out a few other things Egnor is waving away when he makes statements like this:

> Preventing the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria is important work, but the insight that Darwinism brings to the problem -- the unkilled ones eventually outnumber the killed ones -- is of no help. We can figure that out ourselves. The tough work on preventing the emergence of resistant bacteria is done by microbiologists, epidemiologists, molecular geneticists, pharmacologists, and physicians who are infectious disease specialists. Darwinism, understood as the view that "chance and necessity" explains all biological complexity, plays no role.

Sigh.  

Others have already addressed the blatant ignorance of this statement (spouted following a paragraph wherein he claims that the evolution of antibiotic resistance is just a tautology), so I'm actually going to leave the antibiotic resistance stuff alone for the time being.  What I want to address instead are other areas where evolution is critical for insights into many of those fields Egnor mentions, especially since my own research is at the convergence of the first three he lists:  microbiology, epidemiology, and molecular genetics.
