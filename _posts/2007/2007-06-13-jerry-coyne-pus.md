[Jerry Coyne educates](http://richarddawkins.net/article,1271,The-Great-Mutator,Jerry-Coyne-The-New-Republic) Behe about a few common misconceptions about evolution and shows why Intelligent Design, especially 'at the edge' is fully scientifically vacuous.

Coyne reviews Behe's latest book 'the Edge of evolution' and like many before him finds the book unconvincing and 'rather pathetic'.

> What has Behe now found to resurrect his campaign for ID? It's rather pathetic, really. Basically, he now admits that almost the entire edifice of evolutionary theory is true: evolution, natural selection, common ancestry. His one novel claim is that the genetic variation that fuels natural selection--mutation--is produced not by random changes in DNA, as evolutionists maintain, but by an Intelligent Designer. That is, he sees God as the Great Mutator.
