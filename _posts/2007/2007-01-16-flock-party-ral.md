A while back I was trying to organize a Flock Party for the Triangle area; however, I have yet to get my hands on a copy of the DVD.  (I guess it is taking a while for NCSU to buy its copy.)  Regardless, I am excited to announce that the Museum of Natural Sciences is going to be throwing a Flock Party this Thursday, January 18th.

The film will be shown at 7:00 pm in the Museum Auditorium and is free to the public.  Dr. Randy Olson, the filmmaker, will give a presentation and answer questions after the screening.

The full announcement is below the fold.

N.C. Museum of Natural Sciences in Downtown Raleigh

Thursday, January 18

"Flock of Dodos" screening with filmmaker, Randy Olson

7:00 p.m.  Museum Auditorium

Free

Filmmaker and Evolutionary Ecologist , Dr. Randy Olson, presents his new film _Flock of Dodos: The Evolution / Intelligent Design Circus_.  "Flock of Dodos" is the first feature-length documentary to present both sides of the Intelligent Design / Evolution clash and tries to make
sense of the issue by visiting Olson's home state of Kansas.  The film digs below the surface of the debate by examining the language being used by both sides of this "circus" and the actual people presenting each side.  By doing so, Olson poses a serious question to the scientific community as to who really is the "flock of dodos." After the screening, Dr. Olson will give a presentation followed by a Question and Answer session.

The Museum will host additional free screenings of "Flock of Dodos" at the following times:

Saturday, February 3, 3:00 p.m.
Saturday, February 10, 3:00 p.m.
Monday, February 12, Time is TBA -- "Darwin Day"

We are hoping to have a panel of speakers in conjunction with the Darwin Day screening.  If you may be interested in participating on a panel to further discuss this topic, please let us know.

The Museum is located at the corner of Jones and Salisbury Streets. 919.733.7450 http://www.naturalsciences.org/
