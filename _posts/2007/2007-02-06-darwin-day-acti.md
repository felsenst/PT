Also, earlier in the day:

**12:00 pm Center for Science Education Brown Bag Seminar**

"**Forms Most Beautiful: Ideas of Evolution at the Molecular Level**," presented by Dr. Richard Schowen.
An understandable description of concepts developed between 1970 and the present of how proteins evolve to higher levels of functionality, and in particular, how enzymes have become better catalysts. The intention is to make the story accessible to any curious adult. Pine Room of the Kansas Union
