What has the ID movement been up to, following _Kitzmiller_ and subsequent defeats?  Apparently, they are going back to their base.  In 2006 and 2007, the ID movement has hosted a number of "conferences" around the country.  They call them "conferences" because it sounds scientific, but they are more like weekend revivals, actually, where the ID guys are flown in, give their standard talks to the public, and with a full-time professional apologist like Thomas Woodward ([apologetics.org](http://www.apologetics.org/recent-events.html)) or [Lee Strobel](http://www.leestrobel.com/) (author of _The Case for a Creator_, _The Case for Christ_, [etc](/archives/2006/10/ohio-boe-still.html).) emceeing the event.  In fact, the "largest ID conference ever held" [was held last September in the Florida Sun Dome](/archives/2006/08/why-debates-are.html), well-known to be a common venue for scientific conferences.

So anyway, this year a series of "**[Darwin vs. Design](http://www.darwinvsdesign.com/)**" conferences have been set up, apparently in a cookie-cutter format with identical guests and topics, and [hosted by Lee Strobel](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=262&amp;program=CSC&amp;isEvent=true).  

The [bios of the speakers are online](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=262&amp;program=CSC-Darwin%20vs%20Design%20Conferences&amp;isEvent=true) ([PDF](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?id=1281)).  This bit is interesting, and shows us another thing that the ID movement has been up to:

> Session #3 Dr. Stephen Meyer, director of the Center for Science & Culture, editor of Darwinism, Design and Public Education, and **co-author of the forthcoming textbook _Explore Evolution_**, will explain why the information encoded in DNA points powerfully to a designing intelligence.

Oh my, what a _clever_ title for the new Discovery Institute textbook!  It's almost like they picked **[one of the most common phrases for mainstream evolution education projects and websites](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-36,GGGL:en&amp;q=explore+evolution)**, so that they could appear to be teaching science rather than doing religious apologetics.  

And as we all know, **[picking new labels](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/evolution_of_creationism/)** easily solves all conceivable problems with creationist textbooks.
