Antievolutionists have long sought to subvert and infiltrate the public school science classrooms, looking to turn all those lecterns into pulpits to deliver their narrow sectarian doctrines. We've seen takeovers of classrooms, of school boards, and the promulgation of legislation to set things up the way they'd like it. Now, we have another untoward development: not content with turning science class into Sectarian Sunday School, they want taxpayers to chip in money to serve the cause. That's right, instead of passing a collection plate where one gets a choice of contributing or not, they _do_ want to pick your pockets.

The Times-Picayune has the [story](http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/09/vitter_earmarked_federal_money.html).

> Sen. David Vitter, R-La., earmarked $100,000 in a spending bill for a Louisiana Christian group that has challenged the teaching of Darwinian evolution in the public school system and to which he has political ties.
> 
> The money is included in the labor, health and education financing bill for fiscal 2008 and specifies payment to the Louisiana Family Forum "to develop a plan to promote better science education."
