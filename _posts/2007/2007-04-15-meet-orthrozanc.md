Simon Conway Morris and his colleague Jean-Bernard Caron published [a paper in _Science_](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5816/1255) on a new Cambrian fossil called _Orthrozanclus_.  The cool thing about the fossil is that it combines features from two other fossils that Conway Morris previously implicated as transitional stem groups between the modern crown groups ("phyla") of mollusks, annelids, and brachiopods: [_Wiwaxia_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwaxia) and [_Halkeria_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halkieria).  Of course, according to Discovery Institute propaganda, transitional fossils like this don't exist.

[Here is a news summary](http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/3/1/7278).  See also the _Orthrozanclus_ post from PZ Myers, his [post last year](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/odontogriphus_omalus.php) on another stem group mollusk-ish critter, _Odontogriphus_.
