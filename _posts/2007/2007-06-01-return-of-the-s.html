<p class="lead">The Discovery Institute is so relieved &mdash; they <i>finally</i> found a textbook that includes a reworked version of Haeckel's figure. <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/05/the_textbooks_dont_lie_haeckel_1.html">Casey Luskin is very excited</a>. I'm a little disappointed, though: apparently, nobody at the Discovery Institute reads Pharyngula. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/01/textbooks_and_haeckel_again.php">I posted a quick summary in <i>September of 2003</i> that went through several textbooks</a>, and showed a couple of examples where redrawn versions of Haeckel's diagram were used. More recently, I posted a fairly <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/exorcising_the_spectre_of_haec.php">exhaustive survey by Patrick Frank</a> of the use of that diagram since 1923, which showed that it was rare, and that the concept of recapitulation was uniformly criticized. Really, guys, the horse of recapitulationism is <i>dead</i>. Biologists riddled it with bullets in the 19th century, and have periodically kicked it a few times to be sure. For Intelligent Design creationists to show up over a century later and flog the crumbling bones of a long extinguished horse and crow victory is awfully silly.</p>
