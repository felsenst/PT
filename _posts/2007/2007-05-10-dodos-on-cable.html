<p> If you don't get Showtime, the DVD will be released on 28 August, and you can also catch a short from the DVD extras on YouTube, a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/dodos_on_showtime_extras_on_yo.php">clip I've put on my site</a>. Be sure to see why Michael Behe isn't worried about compromising science education in the public schools.</p>
