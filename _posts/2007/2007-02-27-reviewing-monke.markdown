During my recent trip to Buffalo I managed to read all of Edward Humes' new book <i>Monkey Girl: Evolution, Education, Religion and the Battle for America's Soul.</i>  I have posted <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/02/monkey_girl.php">a brief review</a> over at EvolutionBlog. Comments can be left there.  I have mostly praise for the book, but a few criticisms as well.  Let me know what you think!
