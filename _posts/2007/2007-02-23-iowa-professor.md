Via [From Right 2 Left](http://mypc.press-citizen.com/blogs/blog.php?id_blogs=5), I see that U of Iowa physics professor. Fred Skiff, [will be speaking on intelligent design next week:](http://press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070221/NEWS01/70221005/1079)

> At the next "Finding God at Iowa" Lunch Forum, Fred Skiff, University of Iowa professor of physics and astronomy, will speak on the theory of intelligent design. The forum will be held from noon to 1 p.m. March 2, in the Ohio State Room (Room 343) on the third floor of the Iowa Memorial Union.
> 
> Skiff will offer "A 'Fireside Chat' on Intelligent Design." He will discuss some of the questions underlying the debate over intelligent design in nature, such as: What are the appropriate assumptions, methods, and limits of science? Can the intelligent design argument be properly made within the realm of science?

Why am I so dismayed (well, besides the obvious)?  Read more about it at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/02/skiff.php)...
