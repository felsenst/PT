So I guess DaveScot and Dembski [didn't like](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-there-any-anti-id-writings-that-the-pandas-thumb-wont-endorse/) Mark Chu-Carroll's [critique](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/05/behes_dreadful_new_book_a_revi_1.php) (which I [linked to](/archives/2007/05/behes-bad-math.html)) of Behe's usage of fitness landscape concepts in _The Edge of Evolution_.

Well, if anyone is still having trouble getting it, check out [Good Virus, Bad Creationist](http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/2007/05/good-virus-bad-creationist.html) at the blog [ERV](http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/).  The reason I say it's the best Behe critique ever is the style.  L.O.L.  

PS: And watch out for ERV.  She's clearly going to run the planet someday, or at least the NIH.
