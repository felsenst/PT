Gordy Slack was [on the radio](http://www.kqed.org/programs/program-landing.jsp?progID=RD19) in the Bay Area yesterday and the show is now online.  I haven't listened to the whole thing yet but I'm sure it was good, since Gordy is quite a thoughtful guy. Gordy is also [doing a reading](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eve/369322019.html) at Books Inc. Opera Plaza, 601 Van Ness Ave. SF, CA, on Monday, 7/16. 7:00 pm -- I might go myself if I get the chance...
