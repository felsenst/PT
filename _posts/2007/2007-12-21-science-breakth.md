Science has named [Human Genetic Variation](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;318/5858/1842) and [Global warming](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5858/1846) 'breakthroughs of the year'

Quite appropriate that two areas in which there exist a small but vocal minority of people who claim persecution, censorship and more just because the scientific community has weighed the evidence and found their observations lacking in scientific validity and relevance.

Less surprisingly, Uncommon Descent continues to vocally support the 'runner up' concepts, in the hope that perhaps a miracle may happen
