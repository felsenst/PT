Just a few notes on post-Nova show stuff.  If you missed the show (or evidently some PBS stations didn't show it), it will be [free online on the Nova website starting on Friday, November 16](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/program.html).   In the meantime, check out [Judge Jones on the NBC Today Show](http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&amp;brand=msnbc&amp;tab=m5&amp;rf=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com&amp;fg=&amp;from=00&amp;vid=a8362e8b-0301-4a81-bb46-921fda37db1a&amp;playlist=videoByTag:mk:us:vs:0:tag:News_Editors%20Picks:ns:MSNVideo_Top_Cat:ps:10:sd:-1:ind:1:ff:8A) (you may have to search videos on "PBS" if the link doesn't completely work) and [on The Newshour with Jim Lehrer](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education/july-dec07/evolution_11-13.html).

Also, Matthew Chapman, great-great grandson of Charles Darwin, [put out a call yesterday for, "a Presidential Debate on Science."](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-chapman/a-demand-for-a-presidenti_b_72390.html)  I am cynical enough to think that is unlikely, given that there are usually only 3 major debates, but it is worth thinking about pushing the idea -- heck, maybe at least a few science-related questions will get raised in the campaign.  Unfortunately, the comments section was evidently flooded by creationists, so PT people might want to chip in their 2 cents over there.

Lastly -- what did you think?  Quite something seeing stuff on TV that first came to the public [via PT back in 2005](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/evolution_of_creationism/), no?  I have now heard several requests for a "cdesign proponentsists" T-shirt...[here is one try](https://60456.spreadshirt.com/us/US/Shop/), although I think it would be most compelling with a "Evolution of Creationism" or "The Missing Link" title (or maybe the front has the evolution of creationism and the back has the missing link...anyone who is inspired may [use the graph](/archives/2005/10/i-guess-id-real.html), by the way).
