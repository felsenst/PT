[Afarensis says](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2007/06/05/polynesians_beat_columbus_to_a/index.php) that it was actually Polynesians who must have brought chickens to South America in pre-Columbian times, but obviously he and the [researchers he cites](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070604-chickens.html) are unaware of the famed Seafaring Sea Chickens of Tonga who explored the planet well ahead of the Polynesians.
