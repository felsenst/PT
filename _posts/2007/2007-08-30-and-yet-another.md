After posting [**Yet Another Creationist Meltdown**](/archives/2007/07/yet-another-cre.html) last July, I began to mull over testing a little hypothesis, namely that right-wing idealogues caught up in embarrassing political or sexual scandals have a better likelihood of being Creationists.

Well, we have a new Data Point.  It turns out that Senator Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has been up to more than just allegedly soliciting men in adjacent bathroom stalls.

> Then there's U.S. Sen. Larry Craig, who as a House member 16 years ago co-sponsored a constitutional amendment, the "Community Life Amendment," to authorize teaching "the creation of the earth as accepted in Judeo-Christian tradition."

And indeed, right there in the 101st Congress, 1989, there is (then Representative) Larry Craig [co-sponsoring House Joint Resolution 297](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c101:H.J.RES.297:):


> JOINT RESOLUTION
> 
> Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relating to the right of the people to allow voluntary prayer and the teaching of the Judeo-Christian ethic in public schools. 
> ...
> SECTION 2. For the purpose of section 1, the term 'teaching of the Judeo-Christian ethic' shall include the Ten Commandments and the creation of the earth as accepted in Judeo-Christian tradition.

Discuss.
