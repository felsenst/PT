This is pretty cool, a [webpage](http://www.evolutionvscreationism.info/Evolution%20vs.%20Creationism/The%20Scientists.html) full of videos about evolution and creationism with various scientists and philosophers that should be familiar to readers of this blog. They include Ken Miller, Genie Scott, Barbara Forrest and Kevin Padian.
