Although Behe has referred to Miller as an '[intelligent design proponent](http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK2J0FY46FD1DA4)', Miller himself is on the record in many different forms that we should not conflate Miller's faith with his scientific position.

On November 13th, 2007 Nova will present [Judgement Day: Intelligent Design on Trial"](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/) and as part of the experience, Nova is providing an excellent companion website. One of the features involves the perspective of various scientists on defining the [concept of science](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/defining.html)

Miller has two segments in which he explains both the scientific method and religion and addresses what he considers some of the abuses of logic ("a gross mischaracterization to take a scientist in the past ... and say that Newton worked based on a hypothesis of design)

Miller wrote:

> What Intelligent design pretends to do to be in the tradition in Newton, What intelligent design actually is, to be perfectly honest, is in the tradition of the middle ages where they stop investigation by saying we cannot answer this mystery it is the work of God "the designer". This is a science stopper
