<img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/11/11/arts/11dean-190.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />The Sunday Arts section of the _New York Times_ has [a long, positive review](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/arts/television/11dean.html) of Nova's upcoming "[Judgment Day](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/)" show.

~~Also, I have just heard that Kenneth Miller will be interviewed on [NBC's Today Show](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032633/) on Monday morning, opposed by Steve Fuller.  Note to Today Show staff: make sure you give Fuller [decaf](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day15am.html#day15am318).~~ **Update:** this segment of the Today Show has been canceled at the last minute.  So, never mind.
