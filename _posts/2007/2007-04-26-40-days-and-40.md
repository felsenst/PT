<img src="http://cdn.harpercollins.com/harperimages/isbn/medium/7/9780061179457.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />I have been forgetting to mention that [Darwin descendant Matthew Chapman](/archives/2006/04/professor-steve-2.html)'s book _40 Days and 40 Nights: Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin<sup>Â®</sup>, and Other Oddities on Trial in Pennsylvania_ has just appeared in the bookstores.  Here is the [publisher's website with background material](http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061179457/40_Days_and_40_Nights/index.aspx), an [interview with Chapman in _New Scientist_](http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19325971.900-interview-darwin-in-the-blood.html), the [Amazon page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061179450/), a [review](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/03/29/002056.php), and [Chapman's February 2006 article](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-36,GGGL:en&amp;q=matthew+chapman%2C+god+or+gorilla) on the _Kitzmiller_ trial in _Harper's_.

I plan to write a review at some point, but let me say right now that Chapman's version of the Dover battle is _hilarious_ and pretty much every participant gets boiled down to their essence in a witty one or two sentences from Chapman's pen.  I assume Chapman acquired this skill as a scriptwriter.  Anyway, to illustrate, here is yours truly on p. 53:

> Matzke, by contrast, \[specifically, by constrast with AU lawyer Richard Katskee, who "looked as if he had just stepped out of the pages of _GQ_"\], was from Oakland, California, and usually looked as if he had just rolled out of bed.  The NCSE staffer initially assigned to the Dover flare-up, he now briefed the lawyers on the arcane ins and outs of science.  Bespectacles, in his thirties, he was tall and large and peered down at you with a look of beleaguered doubt, as if to say, "You're asking me this question about science, but you know and I know that you're not going to understand my answer, so, although I find this stuff fascinating, wouldn't you really rather go for a beer?"

True enough I'm afraid...
