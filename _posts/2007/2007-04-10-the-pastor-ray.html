<p class="lead">Those rascals at antievolution.org are like the Baker Street Irregulars of the evolutionary forces&mdash;they're always doing the legwork to come up with interesting bits of data. Like, for instance, this wonderful <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=SP;f=14;t=1274;p=55340">example of hypocrisy/inconsistency at Uncommon Descent</a>.</p>

<p>This is what Dembski spat out today, complaining about us manipulative elites (he really <i>deserves</i> a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/fastsearch?order=date&amp;IncludeBlogs=7&amp;search=Ray+Mummert">Pastor Ray Mummert Award</a> for it, too):</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>"<b>Framing</b>," as a colleague of mine pointed out, is the term that UC Berkeley Professor of Linguistics George Lakoff uses to urge Democrats that the public will agree with liberal policies if only the policies are described in different terms &mdash; "<b>framed</b>" in other words. Politics aside, <b>framing</b> is part and parcel with the condescension of our secular elite that the masses cannot be reasoned with and must therefore be manipulated.</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's what <s>Grima</s> DaveScot said last year:</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>I will remind everyone again &mdash; please <b>frame</b> your arguments around science. If the ID movement doesn't get the issue <b>framed</b> around science it's going down and I do not like losing. The plain conclusion of scientific evidence supports descent with modification from a common ancestor...</p></blockquote>

<p>I am amused, and I shall deign to give you peons leave to chortle quietly, if you promise to be decorous about it and not go on too long &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; that was long enough. Stop now, and go back to being mindlessly subservient.</p>
