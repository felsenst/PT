[French Schools Swamped by Books Challenging Evolution](http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070202/sc_afp/franceeducation_070202181212)

> PARIS (AFP) - Tens of thousands of French schools and universities have received copies of a Turkish book refuting Darwin's theory of evolution and describing it as "the true source of terrorism."
> 
> The education ministry said Friday that it had warned school and university directors that the textbook is not in line with the recognized curriculum and that they should disregard it.
> 
> Entitled "The Atlas of Creation", the 770-page book by Turkish author Harun Yahya quotes several passages from the Koran and asserts that "human beings did not evolve (from another species) but were indeed created."
