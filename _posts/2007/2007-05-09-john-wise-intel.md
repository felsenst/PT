John Wise, a biology professor at SMU has written an opinion on [Intelligent Design](http://media.www.smudailycampus.com/media/storage/paper949/news/2007/05/04/Opinion/Intelligent.Design.Is.Not.Science.Why.This.Matters-2894591.shtml)

John Wise wrote:

> Quoting Johnson's own words, "The objective is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism vs. evolution to the existence of God vs. the non-existence of God." In other words, don't allow this to be about creationism-ID versus science. Make people think this is all about a choice they have to make between God and science. This is deceptive at best.

ending with a brilliant reminder

> The foundations of Intelligent Design are in politics and religion, not science. The nature of what we have learned about our physical world does not have to conflict with our faith and understanding of the spiritual domain. Don't let your faith become dependent on the politics of flawed pseudoscience.
