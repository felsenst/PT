You may have noticed that the Montana Law Review let the DI folks have the last word in their symposium on the Dover trial; I'm going to fix that. Pete Irons has graciously sent me his full reply to the "rebuttal" written by Luskin, West and DeWolf and given me permission to post it here. The first article can be found [here](http://www.umt.edu/mlr/Discovery%20Institute%20Article.pdf). Irons' first reply is found [here](http://www.umt.edu/mlr/Irons%20Response.pdf). The DI's response is found [here](http://www.umt.edu/mlr/DI%20Rebuttal.pdf). You can read Irons' final reply to their rebuttal, go to [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2007/06/irons_responds_to_west_luskin.php). Comments may be left there.
