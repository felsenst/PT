According to [various press reports and news releases](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=ice+age+impact&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs), there is a major new paper out in _PNAS_ proposing that the pleistocene megafauna of North America (mammoths and the like) was killed off by an impact event (or atmospheric detonation of a comet).  There was a [brief report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6676461.stm) on this awhile ago when a paper was presented at the American Geophysical Union meeting this summer.  This is a cool idea.  However, despite the press announcements I can't find the paper on the [PNAS website](http://www.pnas.org/).  Anyone have any luck?
