Wilson's _The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth_](http://www.amazon.com/Creation-Appeal-Save-Life-Earth/dp/0393062171/) has [been published in _Trends in Ecology and Evolution_ (_TREE_)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2007.03.012).  Wilson attempts to set aside the evolution/creation issue to encourage evangelicals to join him in saving biodiversity.  The review is currently the online-before-print version, I assume it will be in the May issue.  The journal requires a subscription but I will post a bit below.

I have to add that I take a little extra pleasure in getting to correct Wilson, in my opinion the world's leading living biologist, for mistakenly talking about the "spinning bacterial cilium" when he meant "bacterial flagellum."  OK, I am still a tiny ant compared to Wilson (and Wilson literally is a god among ants, so that is saying something), but hey, I am on a crusade about the flagellum thing.

> If conservationists are serious about making their case to evangelicals, they should have the goal of getting biodiversity on the front cover of _Christianity Today_, the leading evangelical newsmagazine. Wilson's book will not do it, but at least he is thinking in the right direction. The key is convincing evangelicals that extinction is a moral outrage, something at least as senseless and horrible as book burning. Extinction should be viewed as stealing from future generations. Aldo Leopold knew this; he once sarcastically invited a wildflower thief to steal the paintings from the campus union while he was at it \[2\]. Whether a believer or not, 'thou shalt not steal' is a good commandment.
