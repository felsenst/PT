I have been appointed "links curator" for The Panda's Thumb. My job will be to scour the web for the best websites and blogs related to the mission of The Panda's Thumb. To that end I have already added some links to the new links page. I will be adding more as time permits, but in the meantime I though I would throw the question open to the readers. What websites and blogs should be included? To get an idea of the type of websites I am looking for you can consult [the links page](http://pandasthumb.org/links.html). Finally, a number of scientists have made pdf's of their papers freely available on the web [here, for example](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gavrila/Publications.htm). I assume they have the necessary permission to do so, but since I don't want to get anyone in trouble for copyright issues I am somewhat reluctant to link to them. What do you think?
