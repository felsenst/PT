In another observation of pop culture's war on ID, I bring you a remark by [Wired](http://www.wired.com/culture/design/multimedia/2007/04/gallery_mascots?slide=5&amp;slideView=5):

> Apparently feeling pressured by Tux, supporters of Darwin, an open-source version of the Mac OS, decided they needed their own mascot. The result is Hexley, a curious platypus who in some images is portrayed with horns and a pitchfork -- **enough evidence for several intelligent design theorists to offer him as proof of the satanic origins of evolutionary biology**.

This is additionally funny to us because we run FreeBSD, whose mascot, [Beastie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie), inspired [Hexley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexley).

**Update:**

Krauze and several other intelligent-design activists over at [Telic Thoughts have the mistaken belief that in the above post I took the remark by Wired to be serious](http://telicthoughts.com/pandas-thumb-and-hexley-the-hoaxing-platypus/).  To me that remark was an obvious joke, poking fun at intelligent-design activists and creationists.  I still can't find anything in my post that suggests that I was using Wired as a reference.  (I can't even think of a reason why PT would even use random remarks by Wired as a reference for happenings among idists.)
