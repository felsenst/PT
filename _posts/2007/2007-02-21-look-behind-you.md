Everyone remembers Utah state senator Chris Buttars, who [pushed the "divine design" legislation last year](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/UT/374_divine_design_legislation_in_7_21_2005.asp)?  Looks like [someone else](http://www.sltrib.com/portlet/article/html/render_gallery.jsp?articleId=5263957&amp;siteId=297&amp;startImage=1) remembers him also...

> Sen. Chris Buttars, R-West Jordan, left, and Lee Gardner, Salt Lake County assessor, are oblivious to the fact that they are being stalked by an extinct dodo roaming between the East and West Capitol buildings on Monday. The dodo visited the state Legislature to drum up interest for the documentary film "[Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus](http://www.flockofdodos.com/)." The local showing is sponsored by the Salt Lake City Film Center and Utah Museum of Natural History. It will be be shown at 7 tonight at the Rose Wagner Center. (Al Hartmann/The Salt Lake Tribune)
