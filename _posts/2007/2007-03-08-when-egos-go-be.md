I know that SUNY Stony Brook has a great evolutionary biology program.  That being said, the ignorant rantings of neurosurgery professor Dr. Michael Egnor have to be an embarrassment to Stony Brook.  Orac, a surgery professor himself, gives Egnor another drubbing over the incredulous comments he made on a recent Discovery Institute pod cast.

> Rats. I thought that the utter drubbing he took at the hands of myself and my fellow ScienceBloggers (in particular PZ Myers) might have given him the message that he needs to lay low for a while. Apparently not. I guess he must have the monumental ego that more than a few neurosurgeons are famous for. (After all, it takes supreme confidence in one's own abilities to be able to cut into the human brain and believe that the patient will come out OK.) It's not enough this time for him to show up in the comments of PZ's blog to make a fool of himself and embarrass scientific surgeons everywhere. This time around, he's appearing on the Discovery Institute podcast, to be interviewed by fellow DI lapdog and sometimes attack poodle Casey Luskin in a a truly nauseating lovefest entitled, One Doctor's Journey to Becoming a Darwin Doubter:

> Not surprisingly, basically all Dr. Egnor's "critique" of "Darwinism" boils down to is his personal incredulity that biological complexity could ever possibly have evolved from more simple elements without the input of intelligence, his anthropomorphizing the genetic code, and his concluding that, because the genetic code functions like a human language and because human language is created only by the "intelligent design" of humans, then the genetic code must have been intelligently designed. That's it. No data supporting his position, just his "doubts." His propensity to equate "randomness" with "meaninglessness" also strongly suggests the religious, not scientific, roots of Egnor's "skepticism" about "Darwinism."
