Tomorrow, [Talk of the Nation/Science Friday is doing a show](http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2007/Feb/hour2_022307.html) with Edward Humes, author of _Monkey Girl_ ([blog](http://monkeygirlaudio.blogspot.com/2007/02/monkey-girl-friday.html), [website](http://www.edwardhumes.com/books/monkey-girl/)), Randy Olson, director of [_Flock of Dodos_](http://www.flockofdodos.com/), and yours truly, author of this spiffy blogpost.

We are in the second hour, so it should be on from 12-1 Pacific time.  Apart from the radio, NPR is streamed live from many websites, and the Talk of the Nation archived shows are put online a few hours later.
