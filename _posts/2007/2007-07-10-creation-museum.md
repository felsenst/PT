The [Alliance for Science](http://www.allianceforscience.org), a wonderful group of which I am a member, has a link about a survey that examines [public perception of the new Creation Museum](http://www.allianceforscience.org/creatrion_museum_survey).  Having recently visited the ~~Propoganda Ministry~~ Museum myself, I was very underwhelmed.  I will report my experiences there in a future post replete with pictures over at [Neurotopia](http://www.scienceblogs.com/neurotopia).  I feel bad because I haven't been keeping up on the evolution/science activism side of my life for a very long time now, aside from [this post](http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2007/03/science_christianity_excedrin.php) and pushing the Alliance for Science's [Evolution Essay Contest](http://www.allianceforscience.org/essay), I have done very little this year to even address the issue. Might have something to do with my dad dying and whatnot, I'm not sure.

The interesting part of the survey is that "white evangelicals" or "fundamentalists" weren't particularly approving of the ~~intellectual travesty~~ Museum either.  Maybe there is hope for America after all.  Or, maybe the "Museum" really is such a shoddy, transparent attempt at evangelizing that nobody is fooled.

Do stop by and check it out.
