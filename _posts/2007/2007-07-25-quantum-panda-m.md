I've been a busy little bear this summer, and no, I'm not talking about my duty to return _Ailuropoda_ to its once great numbers.  I'm referring to my travels around the globe these last few months.  I've been to so many interesting places that you'd think that I can exist in multiple places at the same time.  Call me the Quantum Panda (TM) if you want to.  My reports from Evolution 2007 will be up later in the week, but I can now give you some links to blog posts done by some of my companions.

But before I do, I want to remind you that you can join my [Facebook group](http://uga.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2368100595), or [friend me on MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/profstevesteve).  The Facebook group also serves as the fan group for PT.

Now to the blog posts.

**From Sandra Porter at [Discovering Biology in a Digital World](http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/)**:

[Professor Steve Steve caught experimenting with human subjects!](http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2007/07/professor_steve_steve_experime.php)---Don't look at me like that.  I have IRB approval from [UE](http://www.ediacara.org/).

[Professor Steve Steve meets Harry Potter](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/07/professor_steve_steve_meets_ha.php)---Not to spoil the ending, but I had no idea that it was all a dream, and Harry would wake up and find Ron in the shower.
