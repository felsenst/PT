<p>Several of us (<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/11/judgment_day_liveblogging.php">Pharyngula</a> and <a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2007/11/liveblogging-pbs-dover-trial-special_13.html">The Atheist Experience</a> and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2007/11/judgment_day_post_game.php">Greg Laden</a>) have live-blogged the PBS documentary on the Dover trial&hellip;if you are in some other time zone or missed the show, you can find out what happened!</p>
