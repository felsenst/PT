While The Thumb is primarily interested in the Intelligent Design movement in its current manifestation (infestation?) as exemplified by the Disco Institute's Center for ~~the Renewal of~~ Science and Culture, let it not be thought that the old-time YECs are out of the game.  After all, YECs compose the majority of the ID movement's foot soldiers in the culture wars (not to mention some of its officers).  [Answers In Genesis](http://www.answersingenesis.org) is a ubiquitous (iniquitous?) player in the anti-evolution battles, and publishes nonsense that's right up to (down to?) Disco Institute standards.  A [recent article](http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2007/0307tiktaalik.asp) on AiG's site on _Tiktaalik roseae_ was written by creationist anatomist David Menton.  Not surprisingly, Menton gets everything wrong.  Martin Brazeau (a student of Per Ahlberg at Uppsala) has [a lovely takedown on The Lancelet](http://lancelet.blogspot.com/2007/03/dr-david-menton-is-liar.html).  A sample:


> In the article, Menton's only claims about the anatomy of _Tiktaalik_ relate to the pelvic fins and girdles (i.e. the hips and legs) of _Tiktaalik_. There is no disucssion of the skull or shoulder girdle, and only tacit reference to the fin skeleton. Menton explains in relation to fishes and tetrapods that:    
> 
> > \[t\]he hind limbs \[of tetrapods\] in particular have a robust pelvic girdle securely attached to the vertebral column. This differs radically from that of any fish including _Tiktaalik_. Essentially all fish (including _Tiktaalik_) have small pelvic fins relative to their pectoral fins.
> 
> Menton is a liar. He cannot possibly know anything about the pelvic fins of _Tiktaalik_. The two papers describing _Tiktaalik_ offer absolutely no descriptions of the pelvic fin skeletons or girdle. I've seen the material first-hand and there are no such details of the pelvic fin.


Menton's article is in the best Disco Institute tradition of "research" along the lines of, say, Jonathan Wells.  I commend Martin's post to PT readers' attention.
