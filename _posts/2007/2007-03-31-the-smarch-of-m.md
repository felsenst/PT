Three weeks ago I attended the the 2007 Drosophila Conference at the Philadelphia Marriott Hotel.  RPM of [evolgen](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/) was nice enough to allow me to stay in the hotel with him, sleeping on the floor and giving me the bed.  RPM took losts of picture and has posted a four part series on his blog.
