[Creationism to be banished from Swedish schools](http://www.thelocal.se/8790/20071015/)

> The Swedish government is to crack down on the role religion plays in independent faith schools. The new rules will include a ban on biology teachers teaching creationism or 'intelligent design' alongside evolution.
> 
> "Pupils must be protected from all forms of fundamentalism," said Education Minister Jan BjÃ¶rklund to Dagens Nyheter.
> 
> Some Christian schools teach biology students that the world and the organisms on it were created by a supreme being. This is often presented as another valid scientific theory alongside evolution - something most scientists reject.
> 
> Religious Education will remain on the curriculum and it will still be allowed to start the school day with prayers. But in classes teachers will be expected to stick to the curriculum.
