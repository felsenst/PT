A new ID book, a new selection of yummy delicious quote-mines to ponder.  EoE offers up quite the little smorgasbord.  Over at EvolutionBlog <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/06/quote_mining_in_eoe.php">I analyze</a> a tediously commonplace example of Behe not merely removing a quotation from its proper context, but actually deleting part of it to give a false impression of its meaning.  Behe has done this before, as I also discuss. Comments can be left there.
