By this point, the name Michael Egnor should be familiar to readers of this blog - but if you need a reminder, he's the neurosurgeon who recently signed on to the staff of the Discovery Institute's Media Complaints blog. Over the last week or two, Egnor has been trying to convince people that evolution is really not important in any way to medicine.

His last attempt, before today, came less than a week ago, with [this spectacular piece of inane argumentation](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/another_postcard_from_a_bastio.html#more). [I responded](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/03/ok_egnor_its_time_to_put_up_or.php) to the arguments that he made, [Orac responded](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/the_egnor_challenge_day_2.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=sublink) to the arguments he made, [Afarensis responded](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2007/03/18/sunday_paleopathology_blogging/?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=sublink) to the arguments he made, [Mark responded](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/03/pigheaded_egnorance_antibiotic.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=sublink) to the arguments he made, and [many other people have also chimed in](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/michael_egnor_who.php) on the topic. A couple of hours ago, Egnor decided to [take another swing](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/quick_nurse_give_the_patient_a.html) at the argument.
