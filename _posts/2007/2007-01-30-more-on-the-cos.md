<p>Walter ReMine (an anti-evolutionist who ardently believes that "Haldane's Dilemma" is a real problem for evolution) recently updated [the entry for "Haldane's Dilemma" at the CreationWiki](http://creationwiki.org/Haldane%27s_dilemma). The update does not directly refer to [my](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/how_fast_can_evolution_work.php) [recent](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/more_on_evolutionary_speed_lim.php) [posts](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/basic_concepts_measuring_fitne.php) on the topic, but does address the points that I made. Actually, "address" is probably the wrong word - he provides a hand-waving dismissal without actually responding to any of the specific points I raised. Ordinarily, a hand-waving response isn't worth the effort needed to write a reply, but in this case the errors that ReMine makes are worth discussing simply because they provide a convenient jumping-off point for a discussion of the way evolution actually works.</p>
