The [_Expelled_](http://www.expelledexposed.com/) movie isn't yet out so we can't make fun of it in its entirety, but as everyone knows by now, the filmmakers started things off rather badly by [lying](/archives/2007/08/im-gonna-be-a-m.html) to the pro-science people they interviewed, making them think that it was an entirely different film with a different name and a different premise.  That's a good taste of the kind of sleaze we're dealing with.

Another taste can be found on the movie's official [website](http://www.expelledthemovie.com/home.php), complete with [press release](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-22-2007/0004649742&amp;amp;EDATE=) and a [blog post](http://expelledthemovie.com/blog/2007/08/21/bens-blog/#more-4) by Ben Stein.  Although they say you can't judge a book by its cover, one has to assume that the claims being made in the press release and by Stein, who stars in the film, were actually made in all seriousness and truly reflect the content of the movie.  I'm going to critique what I've seen so far based on these materials.  The film could always surprise us of course by avoiding the insane rhetoric and untruthful claims found in its own promotional materials, but that seems unlikely to me.  Also, I'm not going into detail about the specific cases mentioned in the press release, which have already been discussed at length and will be discussed in much more detail once the film is out.  Instead I'm going to talk more generally about the persecution claims being made.
