<a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n20/fodo01_.html">Writing in</a> the <i>London Review of Books</i>, philosopher Jerry Fodor offers the latest in a familiar genre: essays declaring the forthcoming demise of natural selection coupled with very little in the way of argument to back it up.  Over at EvolutionBlog <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/10/fodor_on_natural_selection.php">I offer up my reasons</a> for thinking that Fodor's argument is pretty wide of the mark.  Comments can be left there.  Enjoy!
