> BEIJING, China (AP) -- A mini-baby boom last year has pushed up the number of pandas bred in captivity in China to 217, state media said Wednesday.
> 
> Some 34 pandas were born by artificial insemination in 2006 and 30 survived -- both record numbers for the endangered species, Cao Qingyao, a spokesman for the State Forestry Administration, was quoted as saying by the Xinhua News Agency.
> 
> The previous record was the 21 baby pandas born in China's zoos and breeding centers in 2005.
