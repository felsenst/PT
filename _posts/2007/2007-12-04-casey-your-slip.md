Casey Luskin is [quoted](http://media.www.iowastatedaily.com/media/storage/paper818/news/2007/12/04/News/Organization.Attacks.Ruling.To.Deny.Tenure-3130266.shtml) in the Iowa State Daily as saying,

> "Dr. Gonzalez is not teaching intelligent design in classes. The majority of his research is based on astronomy and cosmology. He has stellar reputation as cosmologist and astrologer. Why wouldn't you want a great scientist like that on your staff?" Luskin said.

**Update:** Just after I posted this, I wrote Kyle Miller, lead author on the article. Kyle wrote me back. He says it was their error, and that they will be running a correction tomorrow. So it's actually Miller and Boettcher's slip, and there were two errors: the quote was actually from Rob Crowther, not Casey Luskin, and the error in copy editing.
