For those who find it too painful to watch the video of Bill O'Reilly interviewing Ben Stein on his show last night, I have taken the liberty of [posting a transcript](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/10/oreilly_and_stein_transcript.php) over at EvolutionBlog.  Read it and weep.  (And believe me, I do mean _weep_.)  Comments can be left there, but please keep in mind that I am only the messenger!
