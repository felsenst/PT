If you're going to be anywhere near Amherst, NY this Saturday, why not stop by the <a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/wny/">Center for Inquiry</a>?  I'll be speaking about evolution and creationism, starting at 6:00 pm.  At 3:00 there will be a screening of <i>Inherit the Wind</i>.  For more information, please contact Barry Karr at (716) 636-4869 Ext 217, or by email at bkarr@centerforinquiry.net.
