The Discovery Institute is [passing the collection plate](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/12/two_years_ago_this_month.html) and needs your money. Apparently they base their plea for help on one of the most ridiculous exaggerations you are ever likely to see:

> As a regular Evolution News & Views visitor, you have been continually informed of the ways in which **leading Darwinists have unleashed an unprecedented wave of persecution**, propaganda, and paranoia in an effort to strangle an idea that they insist is already dead.

I treat this claim with all the respect it is due at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2007/12/the_dis_persecution_chic.php). Comments may be left there.
