<p class="lead">Lynn Margulis has sent the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/lynn_margulis_blog_tour.php">opening statement for her blog tour to Pharyngula</a>. You should feel free to come on over and respond to it, raise other questions of any relevant sort, or say whatever you want in the comments; she'll be along later today to respond to those that interest her. I <i>will</i> be policing the comments, so trolls, please don't bother; serious comments only, and keep in mind that she's only going to respond to a limited subset, so make 'em good.</p>

<p>In addition, she'll be available later today in the <a href="http://www.zirc.org/chat/">Pharyngula chat room</a> (channel <b>#pharyngula</b> on irc.zirc.org; if you don't have an IRC client, that link will let you use your browser to join in) from 12:00-1:30pm ET. Dive in there for a more interactive give-and-take with Dr Margulis.</p>

<hr /><p><s>Lynn Margulis is in the house right now&mdash;join the chat room if you have anything to say, or just want to eavesdrop.</s></p>

<hr /><p>The chat is now over, but you can still <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/margulis_chat_transcript.php">read the transcript</a>.</p>
