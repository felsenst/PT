Today's New York Times carries a profile of evolutionary theoretician, [Martin Nowak](http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/index.html), written by Carl Zimmer: [In Games, an Insight Into the Rules of Evolution](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/science/31prof.html).  Zimmer elaborates on the profile [on his blog](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/07/30/picking_up_the_dog.php).

Nowak is the director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University.  I first encountered his research in graduate school, when I was working on the evolution of language ability.  In 2002, at the [Evolution of Language: Fourth International Conference](http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/evolang/2002/), I had the opportunity to have lunch with him.

He is an incredibly gifted scientist, and Zimmer's article about him is well worth [the read](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/science/31prof.html).
