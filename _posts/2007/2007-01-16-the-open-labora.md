Bora of [A Blog Around The Clock](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/) has edited an anthology of the best fifty posts from science and medical blogs in 2006: [_The Open Laboratory: The Best Writing on Science Blogs 2006_](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/the_science_blogging_anthology.php).  The Panda's Thumb is represented by Ian Musgrave's post, [Denton vs Squid; the eye as suboptimal design](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/11/denton_vs_squid.html).  Several other Pandites represent their personal blogs in the anthology as well.

You can order yourself a copy of the anthology from [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/content/631016).

Congrats to all the winners.
