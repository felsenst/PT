<p>Take a look at this <a href="http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/editorial/entries/2007/12/14/official_i_was_looking_out_for.html">interview with Lizzette Reynolds</a>, the Bushite behind the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/11/fear_of_barbara_forrest.php">resignation of Chris Comer</a>. The unbelievable claims come out in the second question.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Were you surprised she resigned?</b></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Yes, because I had asked her supervisor to look into the e-mail issue. But I wasn't kept in the loop. I was at a meeting some time later when someone mentioned, "By the way, she (Chris Comer) is resigning today."</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, she was <i>surprised</i>? Lizzette Reynolds is the person who wrote this in response to the email:</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><p>This is highly inappropriate. I believe this is an offense that calls for termination or, at the very least, reassignment of responsibilities.</p></blockquote>

<p>They're getting burned on this, which is why they're trying to back away with a pretense of wide-eyed innocence now. Keep the pressure on these dishonest anti-scientific frauds, Texas!</p>
