<p class="lead">The <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/a_brief_overview_of_hox_genes.php">Hox genes</a> are a set of transcription factors that exhibit an unusual property: they provide a glimpse of one way that gene expression is translated into metazoan morphology. For the most part, the genome seems to be a welter of various genes scattered about almost randomly, with no order present in their arrangement on a chromosome &mdash; the order only becomes apparent in their expression through the process of development. The Hox genes, on the other hand, seem like an island of comprehensible structure. These are all genes that specify segment identity &mdash; whether a segment of the embryo should form part of the head, thorax, or abdomen, for instance &mdash; and they're all clustered together in one (<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/hox_complexity.php">usually</a>) tidy spot.</p>

<p>How do these genes work together to regulate axial patterning in chordates?</p>
