<p>Twelve months ago I <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/12/the_year_in_id.php">offered a roundup</a> of the "advances" made by the intelligent design movement in 2006, a month-by-month roundup which differed significantly from the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/12/the_year_in_id_di_version.php">assessment of John West</a>. Come on over to <em>Stranger Fruit</em> (where you can leave a comment) to read <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2007/12/the_year_in_id_2007_edition.php">this year's roundup</a>. See the Amazing Dembski make predictions that actually come to pass! Gasp at what we did not see from the ID movement!</p>
