An acquaintance of mine died last week, and I just found out about it. Alex, Irene Pepperberg’s African grey parrot, is dead at the age of 31. There’s no particular cause that has been identified for his death, and he was pretty much just approaching middle age for an African grey. Alex is best known for being the primary subject in Pepperberg's [research on animal cognition](http://www.alexfoundation.org/), and especially non-human cognitive psychology, explored through Alex's ability to communicate through spoken English.
