Denyse O'Leary [notes some of the differences](http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/2007/08/creationism-and-popular-culture-friend.html) between creationists and Intelligent Design proponents:
</p>

> Then the creationists in turn help the ID theorists by making clear what creationism is and what it is not. Creationism is about the BIBLE, see? It's not about intelligent design theories like Behe's\*  Edge of Evolution or Dembski's design inference.

<p>
It's extremely uncommon for me to find myself in agreement with Denyse on anything (and it's not a comfortable feeling), but in this case I do think she's got a good point. Creationism is certainly explicitly based on the Bible, and Intelligent Design certainly is not. In fact, that's probably the Achilles' Heel of the entire Intelligent Design movement.

<p>
Say what you will about the Young-Earth creationists, about Ken Ham and Kent "[Prisoner #06452-017](http://www.cseblogs.com/?p=75)" Hovind, they are steadfast in their belief in the literal truth of the Bible, and steadfast in their refusal to lie about that belief. They believe that they are right, and they are not willing to publicly deny their faith. In that, they stand in stark contrast to Intelligent Design.
