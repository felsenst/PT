I was recently [interviewed](http://www.inoculatedmind.com/?p=168) by Karl Mogel for his podcast show [The Inoculated Mind](http://www.inoculatedmind.com/).  Topics include flagellum evolution and _Kitzmiller v. Dover_, and Casey Luskin's inability to admit error.  Have a listen if you get a chance.
