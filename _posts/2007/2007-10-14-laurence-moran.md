Laurence Moran at [Sandwalk](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/10/evolution-triumph-of-idea.html) comments on a video excerpt with Bill Dembski, recently touted by the Discovery Institute's Robert Crowther. What is fascinating that despite more than a decade of Intelligent Design 'research' this is the best ID has to offer.

Ironically, Dembski starts of by stating that "what darwinists have done is hidden behind complexities of living systems". How ironic can this be... While science, as I have shown in several examples, deals in explanations, pathways and hypotheses, Intelligent Design has contributed exactly zero to our scientific understanding of these systems. Worse, while Dembski mentions some complex systems, he also avoids some examples of complex systems  science understands quite well how they may have evolved.

My thanks to Robert Crowther for presenting the "best' response ID has to offer. You be the judge.

Does he think that the bacterial flagellum is the only other molecular machine? Apparently he does because he doesn't mention replisomes, photosynthesis complexes, blood clotting cascades, the citric acid cycle, or any of the other molecular machines and complex systems where we have a good handle on how they evolved.

Compare this to Dembski's latest approaches [so well documented by ERV](http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/). It is safe to say that Intelligent Design is equivalent to "scientific" stasis.

As Nick, one of the [commenters at Sandwalk observes](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/10/evolution-triumph-of-idea.html#c8956883952717705130)

> Ugh, he really doesn't understand how science works, and he's probably wilfully ignorant of the actual research done into protein evolution. This isn't just bad, it's a stunning example of intellectual dishonesty on Dembski's part. The claim we hide behind the "complexity" of the bacterial flagellum being the main example. Either he's never looked at the research, or like most creationists (and I do view him as that) he's purposely, dogmatically ignoring it. Which is supported by ERV's series on that talk he recently gave.

Now my attempt to transcribe part of the talk, however painful it is for me to be forced to listen to Dembski's description of  how science explains the evolution of the eye, a description which has little foundation in reality.

Well as I said, they are hiding behind complexities. In William Paley's days, the eye, a mammalian eye was as good an example of design as you could find and he made a design argument based on the eye.

They eye is so complex, I mean, multi cellular layers and layers of complexity, how are you going to get a handle on that evolutionarily? So what do we do as design theorists? Well, let's look at simpler systems that are still sufficiently complex so we can get a better handle on that.

The argument so far? Scientists propose scientific hypotheses, Intelligent Design is a minority, so how do we respond? Well, obviously by using an argument based on ignorance.

Note how Bill Dembski argues that 1) the eye in Paley's day was a good example of design 2) scientists have provided explanations that strongly suggest that the eye evolved, leading to the obvious conclusion that what was a good example of design in Paley's is no longer such a good example given our increased understanding of science. So much for the reliability of the Explanatory Filter.

Is this really how scientists establish a plausible evolutionary path for the eye? I will explore this in a future contribution. Sufficient to say that ID has yet to explain the origin and evolution of the eye in their own terms beyond "we don't understand how science explains it thus we believe that design should still be allowed as a plausible explanation".

As many have already pointed out, 'design' is always a 'logical' explanation, the real issue is to find evidence which allow one to formulate a scientific hypothesis. ID however considers such an approach to be 'pathetic'. I can understand since the development of a scientific hypothesis is hard work.
