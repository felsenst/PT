Make sure you don't miss [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5g9Dw0zCI) on a visit to the now-closed Dinosaur Adventure Land, home base of [convicted felon Kent "Dr. Dino" Hovind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA5g9Dw0zCI).  It's not exactly film festival material, but there are a lot of interesting tidbits.

An interesting phenomenon I have observed lately is that now that many Kent Hovind videos are on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), a whole new group of people is realizing just what a wacky dude he was, and just how wacky it is that he is probably the most-known and quoted authority among the creationist public.  [Check out the Hovind-alia on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kent+hovind&amp;search=Search) (if you have an afternoon to kill...the stuff is strangely addictive).
