For example, much of the research over the past 20 years on the sub-clinical use of antibiotics in animal feed has looked how this use of antibiotics as a growth promotant breeds resistant organisms in animals, which can then enter the human population via the food we eat.  Along a similar line, I just mentioned Burt's post [post on cephalosporin use in cattle and the evolution of antibiotic resistance](/archives/2007/03/why-you-should.html), where the worry is that use of these broad-spectrum antibiotics in animals will select for resistance that can then spread to humans.  However, spread of resistant organisms is not a one-way street.  For example, it has been suggested that transmission of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) has been transmitted both from horses to humans and vice-versa (see, for example, [this Emerging Infectious Diseases paper](http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no03/04-0481.htm)).  A new paper suggests that this phenomenon can happen even in animals that aren't in such close contact with humans:  chimpanzees.
