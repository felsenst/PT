During my recent blog vacation, Phillip Johnson emerged to <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3914&program=DI%20Main%20Page%20-%20Article&callingPage=discoMainPage">post  some thoughts</a> on the current state and future prospects of ID.  It's standard Johnsonian fare, full of distortions and inaccuracies.  Reading between the lines, however, it is a remarkably blunt statement of the failure of ID to make much progress among scientists.  I've provided <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/02/johnson_on_the_current_state_o.php">a detailed dissection</a> of Johnson's claims over at EvolutionBlog.  Comments can be left there.  Let me know what you think!
