<p class="lead">Go on over to <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,792,Happy-66th-Birthday-Richard-Dawkins,RichardDawkinsnet">his place and leave a birthday greeting</a>, and be sure to check out the <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/happybirthdayRD">multimedia collection of good wishes</a>.</p>

<p>We wondered what we could do to express our appreciation, and had a hard time figuring out what would be appropriate &hellip; until a student asked to borrow one of my copies of <i>The God Delusion</i> because he couldn't find one anywhere in town. Instead of giving Dawkins a present directly, the Myers family is donating a copy of his book to the <a href="http://www.viking.lib.mn.us/Morris%20Public%20Library.htm">local library</a>, where we hope some receptive minds will discover it.</p>
