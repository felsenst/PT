In an [Editorial piece](http://www.sptimes.com/2007/12/22/Opinion/On_evolution__case_cl.shtml), the St Petersburg Times explores the position of the Pinellas County School Board which insists that Intelligent Design should be taught.

Quoting extensively from Judge Jones' ruling they observe that.

> As the judge found, "every scientific association that has spoken on the matter" has rejected the challenge to evolution mounted by proponents of intelligent design. Darwin's theory of natural selection has withstood the test of time because scientific testing has repeatedly affirmed its validity. Any science curriculum that doesn't fully explore it, or puts it on a par with other claims of life's origins, would be seriously flawed.
> 
> Pinellas School Board members and the state education commissioner might reflect on the judge's comprehensive review and conclusions before they speak again about an accepted scientific theory they apparently know little about.
