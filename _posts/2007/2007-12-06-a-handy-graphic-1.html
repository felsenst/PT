<p>As a follow up to <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/12/a-handy-graphic.html">Ethan's post</a> on Gonzalez's publication drop - and since a loyal reader <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/12/a-handy-graphic.html#comment-137298">requested it</a> - <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2007/12/behes_publications_part_ii.php">here is</a> Michael Behe's publication <strike>record</strike> drop. Behe's productivity has taken a severe hit since he first got involved with "design theory" in 1991. One would imagine that if it was indeed a fruitful paradigm for solving biological problems then his productivity should in fact have increased!</p>
