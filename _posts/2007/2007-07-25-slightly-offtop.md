What you may not know is that, following the television show, McKellar attended UCLA, where she graduated _summa cum laude_ with a major in mathematics (and [published proof](http://www.danicamckellar.com/math/percolation.pdf) to boot).  Since graduation, McKellar has maintained an interest in math and science education for girls, and has been active in promoting this.  She's now also published a book on math education for middle school girls ([Math Doesn't Suck:  How to Survive Middle-School Math Without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail](http://www.amazon.com/Math-Doesnt-Suck-Middle-School-Breaking/dp/1594630399/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2362347-1757700?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1185297391&amp;sr=8-1)) that comes out in early August.  For those interested, I have a review of the book up [here](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/danica_mckelllars_math_doesnt.php) at Aetiology.  I also managed to snag an interview with Danica about the book and other topics, including math advocacy for girls that you can check out [here.](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/interview_with_math_whiz_autho.php)
