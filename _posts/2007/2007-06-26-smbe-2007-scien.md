For dinner this evening RPM over at [evolgen](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/) organized a science bloggers dinner.  Prof. Steve Steve and I managed to make it.  (Of course, Steve Steve is just happy that he is not stuck in the AA system anymore.)  On the suggestion (direction?) of [John Logsdon](http://johnlogsdon.blogspot.com/) we headed to il Mercato for some lovely Italian food.  I had seafood spaghettini, and it was mm---mm---good.

At the end of dinner the waitress was nice enough to take a group picture.
