<p class="lead">Here's an interesting opportunity: <a href="http://chelseagreen.com/authors/LynnMargulis">Lynn Margulis</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis">controversial scientist</a>, is going on a 'blog tour' to promote her new imprint of science books called <a href="http://www.chelseagreen.com/forthepress/electronicpresskits/sciencewriters">Sciencewriters Books</a>. What does that mean? She's going to hang out for a little while on a few blogs and chat and answer questions. If you've wanted to have a conversation with the author of the endosymbiont theory and critic of neo-Darwinian theory, here's your chance.</p>

<p>The tour will kick off on Monday, 12 March, at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>. She'll be sending me a short article that I'll post that morning, and we'll collect comments and questions. Later that afternoon or evening, she'll browse through those comments and answer the ones she finds interesting.</p>

<p>In addition, she'll be available in the <a href="http://www.zirc.org/chat/">Pharyngula chat room</a> (channel <b>#pharyngula</b> on irc.zirc.org; if you don't have an IRC client, that link will let you use your browser to join in) from 12:00-1:30pm ET.</p>

<p>So mark it on your calendars: an online conversation with Lynn Margulis, next Monday, 12 March, at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>.</p>
