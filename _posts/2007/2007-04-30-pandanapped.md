After having dinner with [Dr. Irene Pepperberg](http://www.alexfoundation.org/), Prof. Steve Steve was [pandanapped ](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/dinner_with_irene_pepperberg_a_1.php) by a man in a top hat.  Perhaps one of those intelligent-design activists at Telic Thoughts, who recently accused the professor of being [a panda puppet](http://telicthoughts.com/pandas-thumb-and-hexley-the-hoaxing-platypus/).  They seem to be more familiar with him than they should be.

I know it would mean a lot to Prof. Steve Steve if you friended him on [Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/profstevesteve) or joined his fan club on [Facebook](http://uga.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2368100595).

Shelley Batts (who based on her pictures alone seems to be both irresponsible and avian-friendly) is trying desperately to get him back.  [She needs your support](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/dinner_with_irene_pepperberg_a_1.php).
