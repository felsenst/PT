\[EDITED TO ADD:  thanks! We reached 1000 survey responses in just about 10 hours' time, so the survey is now closed...we really appreciate your participation!\]

If so, we'd love to have your input at a quick survey looking more closely at science blog readers (and writers!):

> This survey attempts to access the opinions of bloggers, blog-readers, and non-blog folk in regards to the impact of blogs on the outside world. The authors of the survey are completing an academic manuscript on the impact of science blogging and this survey will provide invaluable data to answer the following questions:
> 
> Who reads or writes blogs?
> What are the perceptions of blogging, and what are the views of those who read blogs?
> How do academics and others perceive science blogging?
> What, if any, influence does science blogging have on science in general?
> 
> Please consider participating in the survey as an act of 'internet solidarity'! It will likely take 10 minutes, and a bit more if you are a blogger yourself. We thank you in advance.
