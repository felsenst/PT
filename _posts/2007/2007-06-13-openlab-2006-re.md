[The OpenLab 2006](http://www.lulu.com/content/631016) has been reviewed for Nature by nuclear physicist and PT reader Paul Stevenson: "[Blogger's Unite](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/447779b.html)."  (Don't miss the editor's summary as well: "[Brought to blook](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/edsumm/e070614-03.html)").

The review is pretty positive for something that was put together at the last moment using material that wasn't made for print media.

> The entries highlight the great variety of styles that can thrive in the blogosphere. Most of the pieces are a little chattier than the usual book or magazine article, but those chosen are formal enough not to grate on the printed page. Occasionally, the prose is loftier than a typical popular science book. Some even veer too much towards the tone of a research article --- leaving terms like suprachiasmatic nucleus or a zygomaticomaxillary suture unexplained.
> 
> The book works well enough as a standalone anthology of science writing, but I share the editor's hope that it will prompt eager print readers hitherto unfamiliar with the vibrant young medium that is science blogging to have a look, and maybe even have a go.

I am serving as the editor for the 2007 edition and Bora serves as series editor.  As the Nature review mentions, we are already accepting nominations for next year.
