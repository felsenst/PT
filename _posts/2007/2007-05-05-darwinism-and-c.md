The American Enterprise Institute has an interesting discussion title [Darwinism and conservatism: Friends and Foes?](http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1482,filter.all/event_detail.asp) with Larry Arnhart, from the Northern Illinois University and John Derbyshire, from the National Review, and George Gilder, and John West, from the Discovery Institute.

Gilder ended with a particularly ironic comment about emergent properties

George Gilder wrote:

> When people talk about emergence, it's a new popular way of saying "I have no clue".

Does Gilder realize how this describes ID far better?

As a side note: West repeated the specious claim that Doug Axe's probabilities were relevant to a working protein.

John Derbyshire's contribution is excellent.
