Prof. Steve Steve has a new job: [producing raw material for paper production](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/03/26/panda.poop.ap/index.html).

> Researchers at a giant panda reserve in southern China are looking for paper mills to process their surplus of fiber-rich panda excrement into high quality paper.
> 
> Liao Jun, a researcher at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Base in Sichuan province, said the idea came to them after a visit to Thailand last year where they found paper made from elephant dung. They thought panda poop would produce an even finer quality paper, he said.
