There is no intelligent design theory that’s comparable. Working out a positive theory is the job of the scientific people that we have affiliated with the movement. Some of them are quite convinced that it’s doable, but that’s for them to prove…No product is ready for competition in the educational world.

I remain speechless. The real question now becomes, if there is no real competing 'theory of ID' then how can ID have been 'expelled'. It seems to have been flunked.
