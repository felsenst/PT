It seems the Discovery Institute's newest Senior Fellow is radio talk show host Michael Medved.

Here is the Nov. 15th U.D. [announcement](http://www.uncommondescent.com/culture/michael-medved-becomes-discovery-fellow/):

Why is this FANTASTIC news for the [cryptozoological community](http://www.searchingforbigfoot.com/)?

It's because Medved is Big on Big Foot.

Skeptical? Good!  There are [data to listen to](http://michaelmedved.townhall.com/Talkradio/Show.aspx?RadioShowID=4&amp;page=10) on this page; look for show# 232, Monday February 19, 2007, "Big Foot With Michael Medved,"
"Medved talks about recent news reports that there is a Big Foot."

Don't have highspeed? Read [this](http://michaelmedved.townhall.com/About.aspx):


> Dan Sytman, Michael's producer and partner on the radio show, once saw Bigfoot at the edge of a summer camp in the woods. Even before meeting Dan, Michael was a passionate believer in Sasquatch.

If you listen to the whole radio segment, be advised that the "severed foot of a Sasquatch found in Spotsylvania County, VA" that was discussed **at length** turned out to be simply the skinned [Hind Paw of a Bear](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/20/AR2007022001343.html) the next day.

Sir Nick of the Matzke Clan actually had to endure listening to Medved trot out the usual creationist canards on his show, back in December 2004, but [assures us that](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/12/mopping-up-on-t.html)


> ...it was great fun, although during the show I felt a bit like a hobbit in the Mines of Moria scenes from the movie the Fellowship of the Ring: Look out, Medved’s first move is flagrant baiting! \[octopus monster\] Uh-oh, here comes the bacterial flagellum \[big goblin\], and on its heels the Second Law of Thermodynamics! \[little goblin\]. Then, the Discovery Institute list of 300 \[“They have a Cave Troll.”\]

The Amused Muse has [more](http://amused-muse.blogspot.com/2007/11/for-hes-fundy-good-fellow.html).

Is this just an attempt to distract the public from the whuppin' the DI got on NOVA?

Perhaps, but I don't really think so.  They are devious enough, but not that clever.
