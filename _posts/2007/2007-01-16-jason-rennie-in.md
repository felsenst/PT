Jason Rennie of [The Sci Phi Show](http://thesciphishow.com/), who interviewed me [awhile back](/archives/2006/11/the-sciphi-show.html), has put his interviews of Michael Shermer (anti-ID), Salvador Cordova (YEC/ID), Michael Behe (ID), and yours truly (guess) into a [podiobook](http://www.podiobooks.com/podiobooks/book.php?ID=120), which is I guess is what kids are doing these days.  Rennie is evidently sympathetic to ID, but he does let his guests talk, which is nice in this case because at least the guests cover more than the standard talking points.
