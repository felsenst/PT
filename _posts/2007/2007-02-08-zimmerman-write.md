In the Yale Daily news, Michael Zimmerman  [responds](http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/19737) to some of the more outrageous [misunderstandings](http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/19634) by Discovery Institute's Jonathan Wells, author of the infamous (and wrong) Icons Of Evolution. In a historical repetition it seems that Wells got few of the details right.

Seems that the DI is truly concerned about the impact of Evolution Sunday and the Clergy Letter.
