The National Association of Science Teachers produces a biweekly podcast on "science teaching, science news, and anything with 'science' in it." .  The current podcast, [available here](http://www.nsta.org/publications/laboutloud.aspx), is an interview with Sean B. Carroll, author of _The Making of the Fittest_ and _Endless Forms Most Beautiful_, about evolution, his new project, and science literacy.  Highly recommended.
