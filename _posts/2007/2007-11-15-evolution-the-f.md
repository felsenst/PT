**By Dr. Donald R. Prothero**

It was very interesting to see the Nova broadcast recounting the Dover
"intelligent design" trial of two years ago. The furor over the Dover trial
may have died down, but by no means is creationism dead in this country.
Each time they are beaten in court, they find another way to disguise their
religious motives and try to get around the separation of church and state.
Legally, they can't win, but they are still very powerful in the local
communities, where school boards are easily swayed by their phony arguments
and ability to mobilize lots of church-going folks to attend school board
meetings and vote for their candidates.

Both the old-fashioned "young-earth" creationists, i.e. people who
believe the earth is only 10,000 years old, and the newer ID creationists
push their cases largely by making demonstrably false claims about evolution
and the fossil record.  Their lies about the fossil record are particularly
irritating to geologists and paleontologists because creationists make
these claims without any formal training in paleontology, and without any
first-hand experience with fossils, or publications in the peer-reviewed
scientific literature. They wave their PhDs on the covers of their books,
but almost none of them have any relevant training in fossils. Some of the
claims you might still find in their books and blogs:


* The "Cambrian explosion" was an instantaneous creation event. Not
true---in the past 40 years, paleontologists have documented a
3.5-billion-year history of life from single-celled organisms to
multicellular soft-bodied fossils to animals with small shells and
culminating with the trilobites and other fossils that mark the early
Cambrian Period. Modern dating techniques show this transition took at least
20 million years, and probably longer---hardly an "explosion" in anyone's
sense of the word! Yet creationists of all stripes wave this red herring and
ignore the past 40 years' worth of research.
* There are no transitional fossils. Not true---in my new book,
_Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters_, I document dozens of
transitional sequences of fossils, showing the evolution not only of
individual lineages, but also of transitional forms that span the gaps
between major groups---the "macroevolution" that creationists deny.
* Humans did not evolve from ape-like ancestors. Not true---the past 50
years have yielded an amazing array of hominid fossils that provide more
than enough "missing links." Even if there were no fossils, your own genome
is 98% identical with that of a chimpanzee. Every one of your cells is
testimony to the fact that humans are a product of evolution!


As poll after poll shows, most Americans do not know much about
evolution (or science in general), and at least 40% of Americans still
believe in the creation myths of the Bible. This is in striking contrast to
nearly every other country in the industrialized world, which long ago came
to terms with evolution, and have much higher rate of science literacy than
Americans do.  Our poor science literacy is a national shame, especially in
a country where science and technology are so essential and still
world-class (at the moment). If these trends continue, however, will we soon
be outsourcing many of our science and technology to other countries, as we
do our white-collar and blue-collar jobs?
