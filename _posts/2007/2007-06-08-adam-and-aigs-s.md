In more news of the weird [concerning the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum](http://www.wtol.com/Global/story.asp?S=6627249), it seems that the actor who played "Adam" in one of the museum's videos has had other scantily-clad appearances. Eric Linden is the owner and sometime star of a pornographic website, "Bedroom Acrobat". Linden's reply when asked about this was:

> Linden tells the AP that he is no longer affiliated with the site.

A check of "whois", though, says otherwise:

> Registrant:

Note that "Last Updated" date: five months ago. This is in Linden's "past" just like while you are screaming in pain from stubbing your toe that injury is in your "past".
