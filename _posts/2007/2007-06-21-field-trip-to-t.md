I was back in Ohio last week to celebrate my grandparents' 60th wedding anniversary.  While I was in the area, a number of the PT regulars also met up south of Cincinnati to take our own tour of Answers in Genesis' [Creation Museum.](http://www.creationmuseum.org/)  (Wesley has a picture of the group [here](http://austringer.net/wp/?p=614); I'll also try to scan in another "official" picture tomorrow).  

My brain still hurts.  My thoughts on everything over at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/06/field_trip_to_the_creation_mus.php) (with photos, of course).
