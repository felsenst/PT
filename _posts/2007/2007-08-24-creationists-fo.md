This is a guest appearance by Hector Avalos. I (Mark Perakh) have not contributed a single word to this essay which I am posting as a courtesy to Professor Avalos.

One of the most common accusations against "Darwinism" and evolutionary theory, as a whole, is that they lead to the devaluation of human life such as was dramatically manifested in the Nazi Holocaust. Such a notion is embodied in Richard Weikart's _From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany_ (2004). Avalos demonstrates, however, that all of the major ideological precursors of the Holocaust have a long religious history that pre-dates Darwin. We can find such precursors in the work of Martin Luther and among biblical authors. Furthermore, Avalos demonstrates that creationists constitute the most vocal defenders of genocide and infanticide from ancient times to the present day. Therefore, the claim that theistic creationist ethics minimize or eliminate the devaluation of human life is false.
