<p class="lead">Are you a voice talent? Want to participate in an online drama? Sign up for a part in a <a href="http://www.ooblick.com/weblog/2007/02/05/pandas-podcast-casting-call/">podcast recreation of parts of the Dover trial</a>. It should be fun, if you're into that kind of thing.</p>

<p>I'm not volunteering, I'm afraid. I can't act, and I'm also afraid that the closest match to my voice would be Michael Behe, and I'd die of mortification.</p>
