Oops).  Along with other scientists, theologians, philosophers, and generally interested persons, we worked for a bit over a year to put this symposium together.  Why?

> The principal aim of the conference is to clarify the causes of the conflict between science educators and those who wish to have Intelligent Design taught in public schools. We do not claim to be neutral on this issue. We are convinced that ID is not good science and should not be presented as such.  Our position is consonant with that of the National Center for Science Education and the Iowa Academy of Science. We believe that the polarization of opinion on this issue has created misunderstanding and confusion and that a clarification of terminology and concepts is essential for productive dialogue and decision making.

How did it turn out?  I have the write-up over at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/religion_and_science_symposium.php)...
