No, this post isn't about [**creationist Ted Haggard**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjqUmuMhTsM) and his [**male escort/methamphetamine**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Haggard) scandal.

And it's not about [**creationist Kent Hovind**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind), currently serving [**hard time for federal tax evasion**](http://www.cseblogs.com/).

It's not even about the [**lawsuits and charges of corporate theft**](/archives/2007/06/the-us-is-tryin.html) that have cropped up between Creation Ministries International (formerly known as Answers in Genesis (AiG)-Australia) and its former partner, AiG-USA, under Ken Ham, nor is it about the [**on-line porn star**](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/06/07/national/a175033D34.DTL) who played the role of Adam in a movie made for AiG's new [**Creation Supposeum.**](http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/31/1568/)

No, this new scandal involves **Kevin Jackson**, whose term as Mayor of **Rio Rancho, New Mexico** ended prematurely when he was [**forced to resign**](http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/jul/17/rio-rancho-mayor-jackson-resign/) over a slew of allegations of financial misconduct.

So, how is Rio Rancho's ex-mayor involved with creationism? More below the fold.

I have a [**column**](http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/jul/26/commentary-rio-rancho-school-policies-influenced-e/)  in today's _Albuquerque Tribune_ that focuses on Jackson and his legacy.

Real science, of course, has a history littered with the corpses of thousands of discarded "interpretations."

> Even with Jackson expelled from the council, the organization is still providing abstinence education through its "Best Choice" division.

> It's time for a fresh look at abstinence-only policies. A recent study showed that students taught only sexual abstinence ended up with rates of unwanted pregnancies no better than those of students who received standard health education.
> 
> When these abstinence-only programs mention birth control, it is in a derisive way, much as creationists like to mention fossils only as a way to disparage evolution.

> Rio Rancho's sex-ed policies do not meet state requirements for comprehensive sex education. However, the school board has yet to reconsider its stand.

> Science Policy 401 and abstinence-only education in Rio Rancho schools should be re-examined, not just because they were associated with the Meltdown Mayor, but because they are bad for the students of Rio Rancho.

For more on the Rio Rancho situation, see NMSR's [**Rio Rancho Policy 401 page**](http://www.nmsr.org/riorncho.htm).  This page also links to some cartoons I've been doing for the [**Rio Rancho Observer**](http://www.observer-online.com/) to mark the Meltdown of a Mayor.
