Last night (March 26), a friend in Longmont, Colorado, sent me an e-mail in which she told me of a science teacher who had run a debate on global warming -- among sixth graders (see the story in the Longmont _Times-Call_ at http://www.longmontfyi.com/Local-Story.asp?ID=15357 ).  I was in class all day today, but fortunately PZ Myers was on the job and posted 2 articles on the subject ("Another Bad Teacher," http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/another_bad_teacher.php , and a followup, "What's the Matter with Colorado?"  http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/whats_the_matter_with_colorado.php ).

I will therefore just alert our readers to Mr. Myers's essays and also add that the _Times-Call_ today ran another article ("Debunking Darwin," http://www.longmontfyi.com/Local-Story.asp?ID=15426 ) to the effect that the teacher will retire at the end of the year to devote himself to writing and opposing "Darwinism." 

The teacher noted that the district "might breathe a sigh of relief when I'm gone." So will I.
