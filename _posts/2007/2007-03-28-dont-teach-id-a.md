[This is interesting](http://www.metropulse.com/articles/2007/17_13/thats_wild.shtml):

> Creationists welcomed their new leaders to Knoxville last weekend for a convention held by the Discovery Institute, a Seattle non-profit that acts as a publishing house and endowment for proponents of intelligent design (ID). The institute supports a dozen senior fellows and more than two dozen other scientists. Staff scientists are working to develop an intelligent design curriculum, and advance copies of _Explore Evolution_, a biology textbook soon to be released by the organization, were available at the convention. Program Director Stephen Meyer told the crowd it is "premature" to teach intelligent design in public schools. Meyer said, "We encourage people not to push this in schools right now."

The science of ID isn't fully developed, and it shouldn't be pushed in schools, but the revolutionary research movement [founded with a textbook](/archives/2005/10/i-guess-id-real.html) is producing another textbook! (and [another](http://www.fteonline.com/newsletters/200703.html)!)
