There's a recent interview with Sean Carroll, author of [Endless Forms Most Beautiful](http://www.amazon.com/Endless-Forms-Most-Beautiful-Science/dp/0393327795/sr=1-2/qid=1172631093/ref=sr_1_2/103-3423305-2199067?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books) and [The Making of the Fittest](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Fittest-Ultimate-Forensic-Evolution/dp/0393061639/sr=1-1/qid=1172631093/ref=sr_1_1/103-3423305-2199067?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books) on the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers [podcast](http://www.wsst.org/labtable.asp?newsID=280).  Carroll has some pointed remarks about efforts to weaken the teaching of evolution in the public schools:

> I really can't paint this in too rosy of a picture. We've been the destination for the rest of the world for education and for training and even without this controversy the rest of the world has been catching up in various ways.  But now if you look at the climate in the United States, we've so handcuffed things like stem cell research with public officials making preposterous statements about evolutionary science.  We have an administration that has denied the global warming data until I guess it probably just couldn't resist it any longer and you have if you look at some of the agencies,  I will point the finger at the FDA, you have scientific decisions being made by ideologues.  Now, \[if\] that goes on for a number of years it's demoralizing to the scientific community.

And more.  (He also talks about icefish.)

There's [a bunch of other podcasts](http://www.wsst.org/podcasts.asp) on their site that look good too, especially for teachers.
