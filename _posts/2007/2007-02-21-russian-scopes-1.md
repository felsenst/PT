Well, I was having a hard time imagining this one anyway:

> **Anti-Darwin Suit Dismissed**
> 
> The Oktyabrsky District Court in St. Petersburg on Wednesday threw out a lawsuit filed by Maria Shraiber, a 15-year-old who argued that being taught the theory of evolution in school violated her civil rights, Interfax reported.
> 
> The court also dismissed Shraiber's request that the government provide her with a written apology for offending her religious beliefs. Shraiber's representatives vowed to appeal the ruling to St. Petersburg's City Court. (MT)
