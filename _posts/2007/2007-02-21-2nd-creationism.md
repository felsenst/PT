Previous activity on Intelligent Design/Creationist bills in the New Mexico Legislature were discussed [here](/archives/2007/01/creationism-mea.html) and [here](/archives/2007/02/new-mexico-upda.html).

Today, House Bill 506, "AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC EDUCATION; PROVIDING FOR SCHOOL SCIENCE CONTENT STANDARDS AND RULES REGARDING THE TEACHING OF THEORIES OF BIOLOGICAL ORIGINS." was heard today in the NM House Education Committee: only [Mike Edenburn](http://www.nmsr.org/nmcists.htm), at sponsor Dub Williams' side, spoke in favor of the bill.  Speaking against were several scientists and educators, myself included.  

After the comments, sponsor Dub Williams himself voted to table the bill, which was then tabled 8-4.  (I was expecting the same 7-5 split as for the bill on teaching Bible as History, HB 498, which was tabled just before the HB 506 discussion.)  But Williams himself moved to table his bill. 

Only the Senate measures (Senate Bill 371, "SCHOOL SCIENCE CONTENT STANDARDS," and Senate Joint Memorial 9, "OBJECTIVE TEACHING OF BIOLOGICAL ORIGINS.") remain under consideration in the current session.

Two down, two to go.
