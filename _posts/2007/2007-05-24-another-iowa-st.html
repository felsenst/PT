<p>In their desperate flailing to rescue their golden boy at Iowa State, Guillermo Gonzalez, the Discovery Institute has made another mistake: they tried to do a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/a_man_after_my_own_heart_at_io.php">hatchet job on another Iowa State faculty member, Hector Avalos</a>&mdash;he was attacked because he was promoted when Gonzalez wasn't, and he also happens to be an atheist, never mind that these were completely different departments and completely different people. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/avalos_responds.php">Avalos has responded directly to the DI attacks at Pharyngula</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the DI has exposed itself as a nest of bumbling incompetents. I'm actually beginning to feel some sympathy for Gonzalez&mdash;how would you like to be volunteered to be a martyr for the cause? That's actually what's happening now: the kind of circus being erected around a fairly ordinary tenure case is going to be deeply counterproductive to Gonzalez's future career.</p>
