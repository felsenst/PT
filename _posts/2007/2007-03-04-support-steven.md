I wrote back in December about Prof. Steven Gey, one of the great advocates for evolution and quality science education in the nation, being diagnosed with ALS. A group of his colleagues and students have decided to run a triathlon to raise money for ALS research. You can help them reach their goal of raising $10,000 in the event by going to [this page](http://www.als.net/ffc/familyStory.asp?familyID=295) and clicking on "donate now" on the right hand side. Prof. Gey was one of the attorneys who represented the winning side in the landmark 1987 Supreme Court case _Edwards v Aguillard_. He has been a tireless worker on behalf of protecting science education ever since. This is a small way we can help repay all that he has done in helping us reach our goals.
