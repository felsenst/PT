[Unholy row over university lecture event](http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2007/11/24/newsstory10599041t0.asp)

> Second-year dental student Emily Mackie said the university’s decision to call its inaugural Dundee Christmas Lecture “Why Evolution is Right … and Creationism is Wrong” is badly timed and insensitive to Christians.
> 
> The lecture is being given by Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College, London, who claims that all biologists support the theory of evolution and that “intelligent design”—the belief that life was created as part of a divine plan—is wrong.

Steve Jones presented a similarly titled lecture "[Why creationism is wrong and evolution is right" ](http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/page.asp?id=4400&amp;tip=1) at the Royal Society in 2006

> Many biologists are worried by a recent and unexpected return of an argument based on belief by the certainty, untestable and unsupported by evidence, that life did not evolve but appeared by supernatural means. Worldwide, more people believe in creationism than in evolution. Why do no biologists agree? Steve Jones will talk about what evolution is, about new evidence that men and chimps are close relatives and about how we are, nevertheless, unique and why creationism does more harm to religion than it does to science.

Other presentations by Steve Jones include [Why Intelligent Design is Stupid (Hay - 2007)](http://www.hayfestival.com/archive/details_110.aspx)
