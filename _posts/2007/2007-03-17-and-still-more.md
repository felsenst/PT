The Michael Egnor article that I blogged about earlier today was a response to an article written by Scienceblogger Mark Chu-Carroll. Mark has has written his own response to Egnor's latest post ([Pigheaded Egnorance, Antibiotic Resistance, and Tautologies](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/03/pigheaded_egnorance_antibiotic.php)). It's absolutely worth going over there and giving it a read. 

While you're there, you might also want to take a look at [this post by Afarensis](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/) and [this one by Orac](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/dr_michael_egnor_the_gift_that_keeps_on.php), both of which address the Egnorance of yesterday. 

Comments may be left at the home blog for each of those posts.
