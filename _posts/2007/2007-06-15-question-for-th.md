As y'all know, a frequent topic of conversation here is communicating science to the public.  While many of us do it directly via sites such as this one, the bulk of science writing that the public will read is done by the pros--people writing for the magazines and newspapers, among other outlets.  Often, their stories include interviews with research scientists.  However, we're not always so easy to get in touch with, and we blow reporters off altogether--apparently, pretty frequently.  

On a listserv I subscribe to, there recently was a discussion amongst writers regarding how to get academics (and business-types; don't feel the question is limited \*only\* to academics) to respond to interview requests.  However, given the wording of the question and some of the responses, I think the question itself highlighted a bit of the gulf between journalists and academics, so I'm putting some of my own thoughts on why academics **don't** respond first [at Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/06/question_for_the_academic_type.php) (and particularly when they are at conferences or on business travel, which was the topic of one comment), and I welcome any suggestions you have on how _you_ prefer to be contacted--and what might improve response rates for writers.  (It would be great if any writers out there added their additional comments as well--imagine, a dialogue!...)
