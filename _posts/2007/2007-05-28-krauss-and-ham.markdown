Tonight's edition of the Fox News chat show <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i> featured a segment on the big Creation Museum.  Lawrence Krauss defended science and reason against the crazed rantings of Answers in Genesis frontman Ken Ham.  Guest host John Kasich was sitting in for Bill O'Reilly.   I have posted the full transcript, along with some brief remarks, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/05/the_kasichhamkrauss_instatrans.php">over at EvolutionBlog</a>.  Comments can be left there.  Enjoy!
