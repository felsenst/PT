It's a new year, and it will be a busy one here in Iowa when it comes to evolutionary biology.  I want to highlight two upcoming events:  Iowa City's first annual [Darwin Day celebration](http://www.iowacitydarwinday.org/) featuring a lecture by [Massimo Pigliucci](http://www.genotypebyenvironment.org/), and an upcoming [symposium on evolution and intelligent design,](http://spurr.pls.uni.edu/eid/Site/Home.html) featuring John Haught and Wesley Elsberry.  These events will be held in February and March, respectively; more information on both of them can be found over at [Aetiology.](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/01/upcoming_iowa_events.php#more)  Hope to see some readers there!
