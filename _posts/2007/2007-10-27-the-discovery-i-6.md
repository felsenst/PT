<p>Those crazy rascals behind [_Expelled_](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/08/im_gonna_be_a_movie_star.php) have some new games they want to play: they've put out a [casting call for victims of persecution](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/10/you-too-could-b.html). It's a pitiful plea, but it will probably net a nice collection of complaints &mdash; because it's true. We do reject Intelligent Design from the academy, from science, and from science education, and there's a very good reason for that: it's the same reason we reject astrology, alchemy, creationism,  haruspication, necromancy, ornithomancy, and witchcraft from our science courses. _Because they aren't science_.</p>
