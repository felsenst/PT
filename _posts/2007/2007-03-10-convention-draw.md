The Cincinnati Post has [a story](http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070309/NEWS01/703090377) about the possibility that AiG's creation science museum will encourage religious groups to hold conventions in the Cincinnati area.  No word yet on whether it will discourage the realty base community from coming to Cincinnati as well.

But I guess that, with Kent Hovind in jail, AiG is going to have to pick up the slack in the mis-education of America.
