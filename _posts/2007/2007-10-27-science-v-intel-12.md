On Amazon [Behe admits](http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK2J0FY46FD1DA4) that Intelligent Design is nothing more than a code word for Christian faith.

Miller thinks that, to accomplish the goal of life, the universe had to be designed to the depth of its fundamental physical constants. I agree with him as far as he goes, but, on the other hand, as I write in The Edge of Evolution, I think design extends further into the universe, past physical constants, past anthropic coincidences, and well into biology. Yet, with respect to design, he and I differ only on degree, not on principle.

Well, there we have it, Intelligent Design is nothing more than Christian Theology. But Behe is equivocating on the meaning of the term "Intelligent Design". Miller does not appeal to science being able to detect Intelligent Design via a flawed explanatory filter, or via the even more flawed concept of Irreducible Complexity. Miller has accepted on faith that God created the universe.

In that context, yes, both Miller and Behe are 'creationists' who believe that the world was created by a supernatural entity. But unlike Miller, Behe sees examples of continued creation in such details as the bacterial flagella or the malaria parasite.

Miller's review is well worth a more in depth discussion and I hope to provide a more detailed overview of Miller's claims. Needless to say Miller was not impressed

We are at a critical point in the struggle for scientific understanding in this country and this badly flawed book seeks to move us in exactly the wrong direction.
