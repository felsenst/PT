We are nearing the end of the year and and the submission deadline for _The Open Laboratory: The Best Writing on Science Blogs 2007_, edited by Bora and myself.  [Go here](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/) to submit quality science blog posts before the deadline ends, Dec 20th.  [Bora has a list of the current submissions](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/11/open_laboratory_2008_last_call.php), so if you seen any good posts not represented go ahead and [submit them](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/).

Now comes the hard part.  I need 20-25 science bloggers and science blog readers to volunteer to judge the quality of the submissions.  You won't have to read hundreds of entries, just the ones in the categories that you are assigned.  I'm planning on using the following categories (subject to change):

**Life Science:** Biology, Evolution, Health, Medicine, Neuroscience

**Physical Science:** Physics, Chemistry, Math, Astronomy

**Environment:** Climate change, Pollution, Sustainability, Green living, Alternative energy, Geoscience

**Humanities & Social Science:** Anthropology, Sociology, Archaeology, Psychology, History and Philosophy of Science, Ethics, Arts & Culture

**Education & Careers:** Science education, Teaching, Curricula, Lab Life, Grad School, Funding, Evolution in schools

**Politics:** Politics, Elections, Government, Public policy, Culture wars, Creationism, Antiscience

**Medicine & Health:** Public health, Epidemiology, Pharmaceuticals, Health care, Medical training

**Technology:** Computers, Software, Hardware, Engineering, Consumer Electronics, Fuel and energy technology

So if you are willing to judge a couple of these categories, please send me an email at reed@dererumnatura.us with a short message about why you think you could be a good judge.
