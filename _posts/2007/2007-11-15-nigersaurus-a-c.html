<p class="lead">Last August, when I was at the Sci Foo camp, Paul Sereno brought along the skull of one of his latest discoveries&hellip;and whoa, is it ever a weird one. This is <i>Nigersaurus taqueti</i>, an herbivorous dinosaur with specializations for ground-level grazing. Look at this picture; in reality, it's even more striking.</p>

<p>Those jaws and teeth&mdash;they are so neatly squared off and flat-edged. In addition, the skull itself on the spinal column is turned habitually downward. This is a creature that kept its face pressed to the ground as it nibbled its way across the landscape.</p>

<p>Another feature that was apparent is that the skull is awesomely light &mdash; it's mostly empty spaces with a delicate webwork of bony struts holding it together. It's so specialized it's almost comical, and you can imagine something like this appearing on the Flintstones as a lawn mower or hedge trimmer.</p>
