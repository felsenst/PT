Let's say that you are counsel for the Association of Christian Schools. You are looking for an expert witness to stand up before the court and say that the biology and physics textbooks from Bob Jones University and A Beka are just peachy, and students taught from them should be accorded credit in biology and physics sufficient for admission to the University of California system. Who do you turn to? Naturally, you won't bother with a _biologist_ and a _physicist_ for this matter; what you obviously need is a biochemist. Fortunately, you know where to find one, and, hey, presto! Discovery Institute Center for Science and Culture Senior Fellow Michael Behe files an [expert report](http://antievolution.org/people/behe_mj/behe_uc_report_200705.pdf) on your behalf.

Here's a sample:

> General conclusions concerning viewpoints and biology textbooks
> 
> All biology textbooks that were examined, both the approved texts and the Christian texts, contain material which is not strictly science, but which includes viewpoints, and all texts asked students to discuss non-scientific topics, such as religious, legal, political, ethical, or moral topics. In my opinion in this unanimous practice is pedagogically sound. Science does not exist in a vacuum, and students will naturally have questions about how science relates to other aspects of their world.  Discussion of how scientific and other topics impinge on each other and interrelate with each other can equip students to integrate seemingly separate areas into a more coherent whole.

_Darwin's Black Box_ and _Icons of Evolution_ are cited by Behe in support of his expert report. He has a section extolling a "strengths and weaknesses" approach. And, Behe is going to get a cool $20,000 for his participation in the case.

What I'd like to suggest is a little competition for the readers... how many instances of issues raised in the Behe expert report correspond to items in Mark Isaak's [Index to Creationist Claims](http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/)? Please use the comments to add sightings.
