For the last few years (beginning, I believe, in 2004) a lot of noise has been filling a number of websites regarding the “conversion” of British author Antony Flew from atheism to deism.  Recently a new book, ostensibly authored by Flew, was published by HarperCollins, wherein Flew’s newly adopted deistic worldview is defended. Two Christian propagandists, Roy Varghese and Bob Hostetler, and, indirectly, Jewish religious propagandist Gerald Schroeder seem to have played a substantial role in producing that book.  (See, for example,  [here]( http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/11/yet-more-on-ant.html).)

Some advocates of theism try to present Flew’s “conversion” as a supposedly important event somehow proving their beliefs.  Is it indeed an important event deserving numerous posts and articles? Let us see.
