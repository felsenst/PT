David Lampe, Associate Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences at the Duquesne University, provides [some interesting data](http://www.home.duq.edu/~lampe/BeheCV2.html): A comparison between Michael Behe and Sean Carroll.

> Certain people seem attracted to "intelligent design" creationism because some (actually, very few) people with real Ph.D.'s advocate it.  One of these is Michael Behe, a biochemist from Lehigh University.  I have heard him described as "a scientist of the first rank."  People can argue over "rankings" but there exist some objective measures as to how influential a scientist is and how good their ideas actually are.  These measurements are generally of two kinds:
> 
> 
> * Number and kind of publications of the scientist;
> * Citations of these works (which show that the scientist's ideas are being used to do productive work).

An interesting exercise which shows how ID can quickly become a 'science killer'.
