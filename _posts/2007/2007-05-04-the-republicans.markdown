As you have no doubt heard by now, there was a brief exchange on evolution at last night's Republican debate.  Senator John McCain was asked bluntly whether he &ldquo;believed in&rdquo; evolution.  After a moment of hesitation he answered, simply, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Moderator Chris Matthews then asked the ten candidates whether any of them did not believie in evolution.  Representative Tom Tancredo, Senator Sam Brownback and Governor Mike Huckabee raised their hands.

I provide some <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/05/the_republicans_on_evolution.php">further details</a> over at EvolutionBlog.  I've also <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/05/reactions_to_the_antievolution.php">assembled some </a> reactions to the creationist hand-raisers from around the web.  In <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/05/other_tidbits_from_the_republi.php">this post</a> and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2007/05/more_tidbits_from_the_debate.php">and this post</a> I have discussed some other portions of the debate addressing cultural or scientific issues.  Comments to all of this may be left at EvolutionBlog.
