Over at Uncommon Descent, the blog of William Dembski and friends, a contributor has a post up [discussing Peter Duesberg's aneuploidy hypothesis](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/when-darwinism-hurts/) for cancer (which Orac [discussed here](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/peter_duesberg_chromosomal_chaos_and_can.php) for more background).  The post itself is a bit confusing--it's titled "When Darwinism Hurts," and according to the author's clarification, it's about "Darwinism" leading us down the wrong path as far as cancer research goes.  (Though whether cancer would be due to mutations in specific genes or in chromosomes, it's still an evolutionary process, but I digress...)  To me, anyway, the more interesting portion was in the comments section, where both DaveScot and Sal Cordova imply also that HIV might not cause AIDS; more over at [Aetiology.](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/why_deny_only_one_part_of_scie.php)
