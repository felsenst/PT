The New York Times has an [article on the firing of Comer](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/us/03evolution.html)

Why is it that ID is all in favor of teaching the controversy except when the controversy involves showing the history of ID, its demise at Dover, by one of the expert witnesses of the trial?

Will Ben Stein feature Comer in his upcoming movie "Expelled"?
