We are at the submission deadline for _The Open Laboratory: The Best Writing on Science Blogs 2007_, edited by Bora and myself.  [Go here](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/) to submit quality science blog posts from 2007 before the deadline, **Thursday, Dec 20th**.  [Bora has a list of the current submissions](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/11/open_laboratory_2008_last_call.php), so if you seen any good posts not represented go ahead and [submit them](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/).

We are also looking for a good poem and comic to go along with the anthology.

Judging is already underway and it is going to be a tight fit, but I think that we will get the book out before the [2008 Science Blogging Conference](http://scienceblogging.com/).
