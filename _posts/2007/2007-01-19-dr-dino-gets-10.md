Convicted felon Kent Hovind's sentencing was today, and again the [_Pensacola News-Journal_ has the story](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070119/NEWS01/701190332/1006):

> Pensacola evangelist Kent Hovind was sentenced Friday afternoon to **10 years in prison** on charges of tax fraud.
> 
> After a lengthy sentencing hearing that last 5 1/2 hours, U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers ordered Hovind also:
> 
> -- Pay $640,000 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service.
> 
> -- Pay the prosecution's court costs of $7,078.
> 
> -- Serve three years parole once he is released from prison.

Not knowing anything about sentencing, I had figured Hovind would get time already served plus probation or something.  I guess not.  Probably with good behavior this will become 5 years or less of actual prison time.  The moral of the story: living in your own personal alternate reality works for only so long.  That, and don't tick off the IRS.
