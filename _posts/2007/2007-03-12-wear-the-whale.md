As a followup to [my recent fisking of Egnor](/archives/2007/03/egnorance-combo-arrogance.html), I wanted everyone to know that T-shirts are still available. (Do an in-article find for "ambulocetus" and check out the links.) I just bought mine today and it should arrive by the end of the week.

[Get your T-shirts here.](http://www.neoucom.edu/DEPTS/PubRel/shirts2006.pdf)

Maybe I'm the only one who thinks this is totally awesome way to show your support for evolution, seem ostensibly athletic, and needle Behe\* all at the same time, but that's okay. (I don't get out much.)

\*To understand the reference, Behe liked to drop [the lack of whale transitional fossils](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/7738_review_of_michael_behe39s__5_20_2003.asp) (search for "whale" in that link) as a problem for evolution wink wink nudge nudge must have been ID. That was before a dude named [Thewissen](http://www.neoucom.edu/DEPTS/ANAT/Thewissen/), who later became [head football coach](http://tinyurl.com/378x6w) at NEOUCOM got a grant to dig in the Indus Valley. (Behe doesn't mention whale evolution any more, for some reason. But you should.)
