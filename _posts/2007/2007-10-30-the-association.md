[The Association for Science Education adds its voice for evolution](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2007/UK/226_the_association_for_science_ed_10_29_2007.asp)

From the NCSE we hear about the [Association for Science Education](http://www.ase.org.uk/) which has issued a [statement](http://www.ase.org.uk/htm/homepage/notes_news/oct2007/ScienceEduc_IntelliDesign_Creationism.pdf) on science education, "intelligent design" and creationism

> The Association for Science Education -- a professional association for teachers of science in Britain and around the world, with over 15,000 members -- recently issued a statement (PDF) on science education, "intelligent design," and creationism, reading in part:
> 
> > it is clear to us that Intelligent Design has no grounds for sharing a platform as a scientific ‘theory’. It has no underpinning scientific principles or explanations to support it. Furthermore it is not accepted as a competing scientific theory by the international science community nor is it part of the science curriculum. It is not science at all. Intelligent Design belongs to a different domain and should not be presented to learners as a competing or alternative scientific idea. As such, Intelligent Design has no place in the science education of young people in school.

> The statement also cautions against presenting "intelligent design" as a case study of a controversy in science, commenting, "Intelligent Design ... cannot be classed as science, not even bad or controversial science," and recommends that "it should not be presented as an alternative scientific theory" if it is presented in religious education classes.
> 
> The statement cites the Interacademy Panel's statement on the teaching of evolution, to which the Royal Society of London and the National Academies of Science are signatories, as well as the recently issued guidance to British teachers on the place of creationism in the science classroom.

My favorite part

> Should Intelligent Design be included in other areas of the curriculum?
> 
> The ASE does not claim to have any authoritative voice regarding religious and moral education or other areas of the curriculum. However we recognise that an idea which suggests the existence of an ‘intelligent designer’is more likely to find a place in a course which deals explicitly with belief systems. Should Intelligent Design find such a place, we strongly argue that it should not be presented as an alternative scientific theory.
