<p>
A common attack upon evolutionary biology, from [ranking clerics](http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/743/We_are_not_Some_Accident_of_Evolution___Bishop_Barbarito.html) in the Catholic church to the [meanest creationist blogger](http://intelligentreasoning.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-it-is-good-thing-to-question.html), is that it implies that life arose and came to result in us by accident. We are asked to believe, they say, that three billion years led to us as a series of accidents. No matter how often evolutionary biologists and informed respondents try to point out that the sense of "accident" in biology is based on the lack of correlation between the future needs of organisms, the trope is repeated ad nauseum.
