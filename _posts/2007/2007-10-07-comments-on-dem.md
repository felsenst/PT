This is a guest appearance of Erik Tellgren. 

I (Mark Perakh) have not contributed anything to this essay and am posting it as a courtesy to Erik. 

Here starts Erikâ€™s text:

William Dembski has been one of the most influential contributors to
the Intelligent Design (ID) movement. Among other things, his work has
added the terms _specified information, specified complexity, and
complex specified information_ to the basic vocabulary of the ID
movement. These terms are all directly related to the logarithms of
special types of probabilities, e.g. the probability of a pattern of
interest given that it was produced in some way that excludes the
foresight and guidance of an intelligent agent.

In a recent draft manuscript, Dembski and his coauthor Marks extend
the vocabulary with three new terms \[1\]: _endogenous information,
exogenous information, and active information_. They consider as
given a search space and a fixed subset, called a _target_, that makes
up some fraction ps of the search space. An issue of interest to them
is how to measure how well a search algorithm \[2\] exploits the
structure of the search problem. Two possible candidates are the
probability _p_ that a search algorithm is successful and the ratio
_p/ps._ Readers of Dembski's previous writings will not be surprised to
discover that Marks and Dembski prefer to log-transform their
probabilities and rename them 'information'. In equations, their
definitions are

endogenous information = -log<sub>2</sub>(p<sub>s</sub>),

exogenous information = -log<sub>2</sub>(p),

active information = -log<sub>2</sub>(p<sub>s</sub>/p).
