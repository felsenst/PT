Well, it was nice while it lasted, which was far longer than we projected; the [SUCKERED post](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/04/suckered.html) was indeed a prank on you, dear PT readers, pretending to reveal a Discovery Institute prank at our expenses.

We're not sure whether this is a success or a failure on our part.  On one hand, our prank was better executed than the ones at [Uncommon Descent](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/finchs-mutation-paste-gets-results/) and [Telic Thoughts](http://telicthoughts.com/the-end-of-an-era/) and received lots of praise.  On the other hand, many of our readers need to work on their critical observation skills.  Maybe we can blame it on our good reputation; our readers trust the quality of our work.

Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without the DI acolytes providing us with seemingly inexhaustible involuntary parodies themselves.  Indeed, just as our prank went online, Michael Egnor himself out-pranked us with [a real post containing this philosophy gem](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/04/what_if_darwinism_were_right.html):

> Materialism is nonsense, because if matter and energy are all that exist, then truth doesn't exist (it's neither matter nor energy). If truth doesn't exist, then materialism can't be true.

Dude, that's like, so deep.---Seriously, how can you beat these guys?

Anyway, it all started with us honestly wondering, after Egnor appeared on the scene a few weeks ago, whether he was actually real.---The sweet onomatopoeia of his name and style was just too good to be true.---Alas, it quickly became clear he was a real person and surgeon.  As April 1st approached, we considered writing a post claiming that he was, in fact, a prank, but that seemed too direct and obvious.  So the LeCarrÃ©an double-twist was conceived of trying to fool you pretending that the DI fooled _us_.

Andrea wrote the SUCKERED post, Reed made up the faux "[Evolution Views & News](http://www.evolutionnews.net/2007/04/april_fools.html)" page with some pompous-sounding rewrites by Douglas, and the rest of the PT crew provided the usual slew of commentary, suggestions, nagging, doubt, and advice.  The sciencebloggers amplified the effect by feigning dismay on their sites.  

We thought most of you guys would see right through it, but it worked so well that it even fooled  PT contributor PvM, who needs to read his e-mail more often.  I guess years of contending with the absurdities emanating from the DI can make anyone confused between what is real and what is farce . . . .
