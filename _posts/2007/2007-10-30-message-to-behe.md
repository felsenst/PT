Well, if Behe can call Miller an intelligent design proponent because of his Christian faith, showing that ID really is all about religion, then it seems that it is not more than fair that we call Behe an evolutionist for his acceptance of common descent, and his somewhat self-contradictory claim that after God set it all in motion, evolution could very well have played itself out via purely natural processes of regularity and chance. But if that is the case then ID, which is based on eliminating such natural processes to infer design seems to have lost its claim to it.

Really? Bebe has just provided two hundred pages of passionate arguments that natural laws are not sufficient to explain evolutionary change, only to turn around and claim that they

Yet Miller also observes that some tears are starting to show in the 'Big Tent'

Miller wrote:

> Those hoping that Behe would argue  or a biblical version of human origins will be shocked. Indeed, Behe tells his readers that there must be "no relying  on boly books or prophetic dreams," and that it "would be silly" to treat the Bible  as some sort of scientific textbook."

Amen indeed.  

So who was [outing whom](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/behe-outs-miller-as-id-proponent/) I wonder :-)
