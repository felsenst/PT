Kudos to PBS, it looks like they've put up the [transcript](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id.html) and [the video](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/program.html) of "Judgment Day" a day early.  Since there are various reports of PBS stations skipping or editing the show to avoid offending their viewers (or something -- I guess reality offends some people, but you would think they wouldn't watch Nova at all in that case), this is all for the good.
