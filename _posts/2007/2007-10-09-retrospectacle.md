Shelley Batts, a PhD student at the University of Michigan, is up for [a $10,000 scholarship](http://www.collegescholarships.org/blog/2007/10/08/vote-for-the-winner-of-the-2007-blogging-scholarship/) based on the amazing quality of her blogging at [Retrospectacle](http://www.scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/).  

You may remember her as the student who [took on abusive publishers](/archives/2007/04/wiley-interscie.html) ([and won](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/04/wiley-interscie-1.html)) and who [let Prof. Steve Steve get kidnapped](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/04/pandanapped.html).

[Go vote for her; she wins the scholarship if she gets more votes than any of the other 20 finalists](http://www.collegescholarships.org/blog/2007/10/08/vote-for-the-winner-of-the-2007-blogging-scholarship/).
