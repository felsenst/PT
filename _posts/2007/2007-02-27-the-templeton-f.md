On [Wesley R. Elsberry's blog](http://www.antievolution.org/cs/node/216) at antievolution.org, Wesley discusses the recently stated position of the Templeton Foundation on "Intelligent Design".

> The Templeton Foundation, the deep pockets people for science and religion studies, says that its stance has been misconstrued on "intelligent design" [in letters to the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street journal](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-letters4.2feb04,1,4960042.story?coll=la-headlines-business&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true).
> 
> Pamela Thompson, Templeton Foundation spokesperson, says in her letter to the LA Times:
> 
> > We do not believe that the science underpinning the intelligent-design movement is sound, we do not support research or programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge, and the foundation is a nonpolitical entity and does not engage in or support political movements.
> 
> The statement is probably overdone a bit. The Templeton Foundation did fund a number of projects and people in the "intelligent design" creationism movement. While early recognition of the depth of worthlessness and the essential political nature of "intelligent design" creationism was probably too much to ask, certainly by mid-2000 these elements should have been clear to granting entities like the Templeton Foundation. Templeton's retreat from IDC, though, only became apparent in 2005.

Good to know that even foundations like the Templeton Foundation are taking a clear distance from the scientific vacuity known as Intelligent Design. Not surprising, ID has remained void of scientific research and proposals. At best, we have some pseudo-mathematical musings and an overarching appeal to ignorance.

The article in question continues to point out that

> In the past we have given grants to scientists who have gone on to identify themselves as members of the intelligent-design community. We understand that this could be misconstrued by some to suggest that we implicitly support the movement, but this was not our intention at the time, nor is it today.

Good to know the 'rest of the story'. I wonder how ID is going to spin these latest revelations which show how people are abandoning what has become known as a scientifically vacuous movement and the theologically risky philosophy.
