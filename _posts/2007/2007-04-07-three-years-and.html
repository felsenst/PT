<p class="lead">I was just reminded that last year at this time <a title="Pharyngula: An anniversary, of sorts" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/an_anniversary_of_sorts.php">I announced an anniversary</a>. In March of 2004, I critiqued this mysterious abstraction called <a href="/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html">"ontogenetic depth"</a> that Paul Nelson, the ID creationist, proposed as a measure of developmental and evolutionary complexity, and that he was using as a pseudoscientific rationale against evolution. Unfortunately, he never explained how "ontogenetic depth" was calculated or how it was measured (perhaps he was inspired by Dembski's "specified complexity", another magic number that can be farted out by creationists but cannot be calculated). Nelson responded to my criticisms with a promise.</p>

<p>On <a href="/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html#comment-398">29 March 2004</a>, he promised to post an explanation "tomorrow".</p>

<p>On <a href="/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html#comment-731">7 April 2004</a>, he told us "tomorrow".</p>

<p>On <a href="/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html#comment-1555">26 April 2004</a>, he told us he was too busy.</p>

<p>On <a href="/archives/2004/03/ontogenetic-dep.html#comment-13535">13 January 2005</a>, he told us to read a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/modeling_metazoan_cell_lineage.php">paper by R Azevedo</a> instead. I rather doubt that <a href="http://newtonsbinomium.blogspot.com/">Ricardo</a> supports Intelligent Design creationism, or thinks his work contributes to it.</p>

<p>Ever since, silence.</p>

<p>One day has stretched into three years. I would fear that Paul Nelson has fallen into a chronosynclastic infundibulum and come unstuck in time, except that he still pops up saying the same stuff at creationist conferences. Maybe he just forgot, and this thread will remind him so that he'll show up and post that promised explanation in a comment.</p>

<p>Tomorrow.</p>
