Check out [the final exchange about intelligent design](http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11974) between John Derbyshire and Tom Bethell, where Bethell insists that creationism and intelligent design are as different as chalk and cheese.   ([Part 1 here](http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11878); [Part 2 here](http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11929).)

In it, Bethell demonstrates once again why he is a [blathering buffoon](http://recursed.blogspot.com/2005/12/bethells-blather.html).   Bethell tells us that "Structures or signals of specified complexity permit an inference to design without any necessary recourse to the supernatural" without bothering to mention that "specified complexity" is [junk mathematics](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/eandsdembski.pdf) and doesn't permit an inference to anything at all, except that Bethell is rather gullible to accept William Dembski's assurances as gospel.
