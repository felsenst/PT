Steven Pinker, _The Stuff of Thought:  Language as a Window into Human Nature_, New York:  Viking, 2007, p. 280.

> The abundance of Steves in turn-of-the-century science has led to the most formidable weapon in the fight against neo-creationism today:  Project Steve.  A brainchild of the National Center for Science Education, the initiative is a parody of the creationist tradition of publishing lists of several dozen "scientists who dissent from Darwinism."  The NCSE replies:  "Oh, yeah?  Well, we have a list of several _hundred_ scientists who _affirm_ evolution---_just named Steve!_"  (And Stephanie, Steffi, Stefan, and Esteban.)  Part satire, part memorial to Stephen Jay Gould, the project maintains a Steve-O-Meter (now pointing past 800) and has spun off a T-shirt, a song, a mascot (Professor Steve Steve, a panda puppet), and a paper in the respected scientific journal _Annals of Improbable Research_ called "The Morphology of Steve" (based on the T-shirt sizes ordered by the signatories).
