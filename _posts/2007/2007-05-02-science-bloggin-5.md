As the 2007 [Science](http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/2007+Science+Blogging+Conference) [Blogging](http://wiki.blogtogether.org/blogtogether/show/Conference+Links+and+Liveblogging) [Conference](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/conference_blogging.php) was such a great success, we are already in full swing in organizing the [2008](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/announcement_get_ready_for_the.php) [conference](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/announcing_the_2008_science_bl.php) and hoping to make it even bigger and better than the first one.

Our beta-version wiki is up---check out the [homepage](http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/North+Carolina+Science+Blogging+Conference) and the first, rough outlines of the [program](http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/Conference+Program+08) (feel free to edit the page and add your idea at the bottom or in the comments).  At this point we are trying to get more [sponsors](http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/Sponsorships) so if you and your organization/company/magazine is interested, let us know soon.

Check out out [blog](http://blogtogether.org/) for updates.

Last time, almost in time for the conference, we edited and published the first-ever [science blogging anthology](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/the_science_blogging_anthology.php), the [Open Laboratory 2006](http://www.lulu.com/content/631016), which was an instant hit.  Thus, we are already collecting nominations for the [next years' edition](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/03/have_you_nominated_a_post_for.php).  Send us your best posts (or best posts written by others) of the year by using [this submission form](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/) and help us spread the news by adding [this code](http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2007/03/openlab_2007.html) to your blog or website.
