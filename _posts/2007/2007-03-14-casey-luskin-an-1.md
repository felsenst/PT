PZ has done a [**splendid job**](/archives/2007/03/luskin-and-the.html) of disemboweling Casey Luskin's [**silly screed**](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/antiscience_activists_oppose_t.html) about my op-ed from [**yesterday's Albuquerque Tribune**](http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/mar/13/commentary-intelligent-design-supporters-find-new-/).

Speaking of me, Luskin complains 

> He says that the "creationists" are getting "sneakier,"...

But, readers of the Thumb already know this is **exactly** what's happening. This is a totally inappropriate use of **"**scare quotes**"**, and I'm calling Luskin on it.

As I discussed in [**"Cheshire Cat" Creationism in New Mexico**](/archives/2007/02/cheshire-cat-cr.html), the very "science-y"-looking website for the  [**"New Mexico Science Foundation"**](http://www.nmsciencefoundation.org/) is simply a front for the young-earth creationists at the [**Creation Science Fellowship of New Mexico (CSFNM)**](http://www.swcp.com/creation/).

To see why Luskin's scare quotes are silly, just take these steps:
(1) Browse the science-y-looking "New Mexico Science Foundation"[**website**](http://www.nmsciencefoundation.org/).

(2) Copy the domain name, www.nmsciencefoundation.org, into any convenient WHOIS utility.  See that the registrant is Mark Burton, with e-mail address principlesATintegrity.com

(3) Do a Google Search for [**"Mark Burton" NM**](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Mark+Burton%22+NM&amp;btnG=Google+Search), and follow the links to Burton's [**Christian home-schooling website**](http://www.rges.cc/staff.htm), his involvement in the [**creationist debate with NMSR**](http://www.nmsr.org/debate_0.htm), or his [**long-standing association with the Creation Science Fellowship of NM**](http://www.swcp.com/creation/news/9902.htm).

(4) If your name is Casey Luskin, go look up the [**definition of Q.E.D.**](http://www.wordsmyth.net/live/home.php?script=search&amp;matchent=Q.E.D.&amp;matchtype=exact)

By the way, Luskin made no mention of my favorite point in the op-ed:


> Look out for complaints that simply teaching the scientific method - testing real-world (natural) explanations - somehow denies even the possibility of a guiding intelligence above it all. **Science is not "atheism" just because it cannot invoke supernatural causality.**

Only a few days left in the Legislative Session.  So far, so good.
