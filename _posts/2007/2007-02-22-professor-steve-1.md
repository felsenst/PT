<img src="http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u57/aetiology/DSCN1867.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />  Greetings again!

I've just returned from the [annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science](/archives/2007/02/prof-steve-stev-4.html) (AAAS for you acronymophiles) in San Francisco.  What a city!  I mean, sure, I hang out here a lot with the [NCSE folks](http://www.natcenscied.org/), but I rarely have a chance to schmooze with other scientists of my caliber from out of town.  I mean, not that anyone I met has [quite my qualifications](/archives/2005/03/project-steve-s.html), but I had a lot of fun meeting people (including the hottie in the picture) and, of course, hearing more about evolutionary biology in the meantime.   Read all about it over at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/02/prof_steve_steve_does_aaas_1.php).
