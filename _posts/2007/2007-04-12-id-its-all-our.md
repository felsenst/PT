Here's an update to [**"Is There A Systems Biologist In The House?"**](/archives/2007/03/is-there-a-syst.html), in which I described how the head of the New Mexico chapter of the Intelligent Design Network (IDnet), Joe Renick, put a whole new spin on "Systems Biology" in [**~~an editorial~~ commentary published in the Albuquerque Tribune (March 28th)**](http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/mar/28/commentary-fear-exposure/):

In my initial responses to Renick, found  [**here**](/archives/2007/03/is-there-a-syst.html) and [**here (comments)**](http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/mar/28/commentary-fear-exposure/), I argued that

and

Recently, Joe Renick sent me a letter to clarify his position on Systems Biology and Intelligent Design, and allowed it to be published in the [**April NMSR Reports**](http://www.nmsr.org/APR2007.pdf).

Renick said all this talk about him wanting to get ID into schools is baseless:

I kid you not.  Read on below the fold.

In every case they argue that it is natural selection that accounts for these design-like appearances. Michael Ruse wrote an entire book on the subject "Darwin and Design" and he carefully makes the distinction between the "appearance of design" in biology and a "conclusion to a designer". His whole argument is that Darwin found a "designer substitute", natural selection, with the result that an appeal to a creator was no longer necessary.

I get 45,800,000 "hits" when I [google "systems biology design"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Systems+Biology+design%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search). It appears that many of those "hits" are irrelevant to the context of systems biology itself but many others talk about design principles or engineering principles and their application in the understanding of higher order processes and cellular activities. One of the attachments provides a short list of google hits that capture these ideas and I have attached an [article by James Shapiro](http://bostonreview.net/BR22.1/shapiro.html) that provides his views on the subject. **Clearly, all research in systems biology is still done within an evolutionary framework and a focus of much of this work is to provide an expanded understanding of how evolution produced these complex systems. This is the way science is supposed to work!**

I admit to the obvious implications, but it is impossible to make a conclusion to a transcendent designer within the methological limits of science and I have never done that.** As a Christian, I am quite happy with the teleological implications of design just as many materialists are quite happy with the naturalistic implications of natural selection. But our metaphysical views should not drive our science.

Well, excuuuuuuse me!  I guess I thought that when the head of IDnet-NM wrote in the Albuquerque Tribune about the "_hopeless inability of Darwinian principles to explain the complexity observed in living things_," he was suggesting that natural sciences can **not** explain the complexity of organisms, and therefore a transcendant "Intelligent Designer" is implicated as such a source.

Isn't this what ID is supposed to be about?  Why, just two days ago, Discovery Institute stalwarts Bruce Chapman and John West wrote this in the [**Dallas Morning News**](http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-bchapman_10edi.ART.State.Edition1.43d902d.html):


> Intelligent design does not challenge the idea that evolution occurs, rather the claim that the development of the intricate and highly functional features in nature is the result of a blind and undirected process that cannot select for future function.

 

So, if all Renick wanted to do was to have discussions of "cutting edge of research in the biological sciences" in New Mexico science classrooms -- e.g., simply teach mainstream, peer-reviewed science -- why did he and his followers demand a totally unnecessary [**NEW LAW**](/archives/2007/02/2nd-creationism.html) from NM's legislature?  (All four creo measures in the 2007 session of the New Mexico legislature were [**defeated**](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2007/NM/993_antievolution_measures_dead_in_3_22_2007.asp), by the way!)  It's quite clear that Renick doesn't simply want students to stay "within the methological \[_sic_\] limits of science."

He wants to add just one little thing: the idea that all that science is **WRONG**.

In other words, Renick wants to teach the [Strengths and **Weaknesses** of Evolution](http://www.nmidnet.org/Strengths%20and%20Weaknesses_v1.doc).

These "weaknesses" are the core of "Intelligent Design," and found nowhere else, except in "Creation Science."

But when I pointed that out, I'm now told that **_You and your colleagues are the ones making the conclusion to a designer, not me._**

[Yeah, right.](http://hometown.aol.com/uwavoholic/yeahrite.wav)
