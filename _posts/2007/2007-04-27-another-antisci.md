I don't typically cross-post many of my infectious disease topics over here unless they have a clear evolution slant, but I thought I'd let readers know about a recent case in Australia, where a HIV+ man was convicted of endangering the lives of three women by exposing them to the virus via unprotected sex.  He appealed, and the basis of his appeal was the assertion that [HIV doesn't exist](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/02/hivs_dover.php), a claim backed by some so-called "HIV dissidents" who use tactics very similar to creationists:  quote-mining, misrepresentation off the literature, etc.  The judge came back with his decision on the whole circus today, and I discuss the results at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/04/verdict_back_in_hiv_denial_app.php).
