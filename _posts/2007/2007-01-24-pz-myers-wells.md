PZ reports on Wells: [Jonathan Wells knows nothing about development, part I](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/jonathan_wells_knows_nothing_a.php?utm_source=mostactive&amp;utm_medium=link)

> If one were asked who the very worst advocate for Intelligent Design creationism was, it would be a difficult decision---there are so many choices! Should we go back to first principles and pick PJ Johnson, the cunning lawyer who has the goal of undermining all of science? Smarmy and obtuse Sal Cordova? Pompous and vacuous William Dembski? I'm afraid my personal most loathed ID creationist has got to be Jonathan Wells.
> 
> The reason? The man claims to be a developmental biologist, my favorite field of science, and actually has some credentials in the discipline...but every time he speaks out on the subject, he stuns me with his ignorance. Here he is, trying to explain the Cambrian explosion.

Note that this is part I, apparently Jonathan Wells has written an even more outrageous claim.
