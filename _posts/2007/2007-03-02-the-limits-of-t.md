Casey Luskin, over at the Discovery Institute's Media Complaints blog [doesn't like the reaction](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/03/proaclu_crowd_cheers_for_pz_my.html) that an Idaho crowd had to a PZ Myers quote. He believes that both Myers and the crowd were being intolerant.

Here's the PZ quote at the center of the issue. Actually, as Paul points out in [his own response to Casey](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/03/get_meaner_angrier_louder_fier.php), the "quote" is actually two separate quotes taken from two totally separate posts, and stuck together with a totally inappropriate ellipsis. (When two statements appear on two separate websites two months apart, you really aren't supposed to link them with three little dots and pretend that it's all one quote.)
