Is it just me, or is there something particularly ludicrous and pitiful about [Ruse (or anyone) discussing with Paul Nelson](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/ruse-versus-nelson-what-would-make-us-change-our-minds-an-unconventional-debate-october-4/) what evidence would make Paul Nelson change his mind about ID, when Nelson isn't even man enough to lift his head up out of the sand the tiny bit required to admit that the earth is old, that this is a hard evidentiary fact, that denying it is as perverse as denying that the Earth is round, and that the promotion of the young-earth view in evangelical churches is one of the greatest frauds in American history?

Of course, Ruse is too much of a softy to ask these kinds of questions,\* which is exactly why the IDers keep inviting him (and paying him) to do these debates.

(\* To be clear: Ruse is useful and a pro-science warrior on many things, but one thing he doesn't do much of is challenge the creationists scientifically and force them to deal with the hard evidence that challenges their beliefs.  Doing this takes a lot more work of course and only a few people are good at it.)
