A recent conversation brought up the subject of one of my favorite animals---and one of the more remarkable examples of evolution: the Fishing Cat (_Prionailurus viverrinus_). The Fishing Cat is just that---a cat that subsists on fish, and [that swims naturally.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USvcrx8_OB4) In fact, the Fishing Cat _actually has webbed paws._

They're a little bigger than a bobcat, about three and a half feet long (including tail), and are native to southeast Asia, where they live beside rivers, [hunting for fish.](http://www.idiocentrism.com/FishingCat%20XX.jpg) They don't just scoop the fish out with their paws; they swim and dive under the water to catch fish. There are several zoos that have Fishing Cats, including the National Zoo in Washington; you can watch [a video of Fishing Cats hunting](http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AsiaTrail/FishingCats/fishing/) at their website. Personally, I'm fond of the cats at the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound in Rosamond, California; they have some adorable pictures of Fishing Kittens [on their website.](http://www.cathouse-fcc.org/fishingcat.html)
