<p class="lead">I recently mentioned the way some <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/10/never_try_to_exorcise_an_athei.php">serious theologians believe in demons and exorcisms</a>. I can't help it; I find these notions ridiculous to an extreme, and the absurdity of serious scholars blaming diseases on demonic possession in the 21st century is something one has to find laughable. I was being hard on Christianity, though. I left out an important exonerating factor for these people.</p>

<p>Some of them believe in <i>angels</i>, too.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm joking when I say this is an exonerating factor. This merely makes them even more silly. But no, you say, they can't possibly argue for demons and angels being real agents in the natural world, can they? This must all be metaphorical, not literal. Judge for yourself.</p>

<p>Here's a passage from the foreword to a 2002 book by Peter S. Williams, <i>The Case for Angels</i>. This is a book that argues for the literal reality of angels, and that they are important because <span class="creationist">"Angels (with a capital 'A', good angels) are worth studying because they are true (real), noble, right pure, lovely, admirable, excellent <i>and</i> praiseworthy. Fallen angels (demons are worth studying because they are real and because it behoves every army, including the army of Christ, to know its enemy."</span> The author of the foreword agrees. Can you guess who it is?</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Peter Williams' <i>The Case for Angels</i> is about&hellip;the theological rift between a Christian intelligentsia that increasingly regards angels only as figurative or literary devices, and the great mass of Christians who thankfully still regard them as real (a fact confirmed by popular polls, as Williams notes in this book). This rift was brought home to me at a conference I helped organize at Baylor University some years back. The conference was entitled 'The Nature of Nature' and focused on whether nature is self-contained or points beyond itself. The activity of angels in the world would clearly constitute on way nature points beyond itself.</p></blockquote>
