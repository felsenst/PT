This good news comes from Idaho's Science Teachers Association who have approved an official position against teaching intelligent design in Idaho's public schools.

Ironically, Idaho's Science Teachers Association has a website at the address "idscienceteachers.org" :-)

The [Christian Post](http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070302/26099_Intelligent_Design_Conference_to_Address_Nationwide_School_Disputes.htm) reports

> In Idaho this past weekend, science teachers officially noted that they will not allow the instruction of intelligent design in their school systems.
> 
> The Idaho Science Teachers Association supported their position by saying that intelligent design, an opposing conjecture to evolution theory, is not approved by the scientific community, so it has no place being taught as a science.
> 
> "It basically would be unethical to teach creation science or intelligent design because it is not science, and it does not belong in a science classroom," said Rick Alm, president of the ISTA's board, in the Idaho Statesman.
