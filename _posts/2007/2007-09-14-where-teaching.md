On "Threads from Henry's Web", Henry Neufeld writes more about Colling and 'teaching the controversy'

>  This action shows some of the destructive potential of ignorance, but it also removes any fig-leaf of respectability from the “teach the controversy” argument. **The advocates of creationism generally do not want the controversy taught. They want to win.** If they were to win a court case allowing their materials into the public school classrooms, their next move would be to prevent critical examination of those ideas, and then to prevent the teaching of evolutionary theory itself. I simply don’t believe the public propaganda. I never have, but the evidence that it is pure propaganda just keeps building up.

Henry describes himself as "... an author and lecturer, owner of Energion Publications, and president of Pacesetters Bible School."  His description of the problems and risks of ID seem timely and to the point.
