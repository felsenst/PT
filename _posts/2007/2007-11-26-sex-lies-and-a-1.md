In [**"sex, lies and a math mistake"**](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/11/sex-lies-and-a.html) I described how the Discovery Institute's rapid response to the NOVA program on ID (a booklet called [_“The Theory of Intelligent Design: A briefing packet for educators, to help teachers understand the debate between Darwinian evolution and intelligent design”_](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=1453))  was filled with egregious math errors and lies.

Perhaps it's getting cold down under (and I _don't_ mean Australia), but the Discovery Institute has actually corrected the math mistake in their booklet.

Of course, they did not acknowledge making a mistake, nor did they acknowledge making a correction.

They simply [_re-announced the release of the revised booklet, without mentioning that it was a revision_](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/11/a_new_resource_for_educators_d.html).

Anyway, there has been a little progress.  Now all they need to do is to get rid of the aforementioned [**lies**](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/11/sex-lies-and-a.html).
