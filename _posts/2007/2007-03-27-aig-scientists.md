But it's not all fun and games.  Trying to figure out how to cram Earth history into 6000 years, how to cram thousands of species onto a wooden Ark, and how to cram all this nonsense down people's throats can be hard work.  That's why they've called in a team of crack scientists to resolve some of the hairier issues.  One of the museum's scriptwriters [explains](http://answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v2/n2/meeting-scientists):

> In designing a museum for the next generation, we clearly understood from the start that we had to be forward thinking, to gather the latest research, and to imagine where science will be five years from now. We needed a science reference board, made up of some of the very best experts in every field.

And what are these best experts working on?

> "Based on genetics, I think Adam's chest hair needs to be short, like Sean Connery's."
> 
> The conversations with scientists were never dull. In one memorable discussion, a sixty-something college professor threw back his chair, jumped up, then started lumbering about like an ape to explain how a monkey walks.

Decades of education and research have clearly paid off.
