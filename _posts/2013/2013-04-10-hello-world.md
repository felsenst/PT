I am thrilled to start cross-posting on Panda's Thumb (from my small corner of the internet at [mathbionerd.blogspot.com](mathbionerd.blogspot.com)). I'm an evolutionary biologist studying many things, which generally involve sex-specific processes (sex chromosome evolution, meiosis, male mutation bias: [http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~sayres)](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~sayres)). I am dedicated to communicating science in language that is accessible to general audiences. So, here I'll be posting "accessible research", as well as other bits about science careers.
