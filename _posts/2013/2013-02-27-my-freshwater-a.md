A brief note to let readers know that my analysis of the oral arguments before the Ohio Supreme Court will be up in a couple of days. I have some background material coming from outsiders that's yet to arrive, and my tomorrow is almost fully booked already. So: Friday at the earliest, and possibly Saturday.
