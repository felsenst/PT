[Today is the 10th anniversary](http://ncse.com/news/2013/02/ten-years-project-steve-0014715) of NCSE's [Project Steve](http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve):

> "Project Steve" is a tongue-in-cheek parody of a long-standing creationist tradition of amassing lists of "scientists who doubt evolution" or "scientists who dissent from Darwinism."

Conceived in discussions amongst NCSE staffers and members of the old [TalkDesign group](http://www.talkdesign.org/cs/) (several of whom went on to be founding contributors to Panda's Thumb), the Steve-O-Meter currrently shows 1,239 scientists whose first name is Steve or a cognate, including the two eligible living Nobel winners (Chu and Weinberg), who have signed on to this statement:

> Evolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to "intelligent design," to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools.

Since "Steve" and cognates comprise roughly 1% of first names, that corresponds to over 120,000 scientists concurring with the statement.

Compare that to the wishy-washy [Scientific Dissent from Darwinism](http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/) statement maintained by the Disco 'Tute:

> We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.
