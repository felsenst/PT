<big>[_Narcissus_ sp.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_%28plant%29) -- daffodil.</big> Slightly off task, but this daffodil was one of many passed out at a [ceremony](http://www.dailycamera.com/louisville-news/ci_22852426/boulder-mans-testimony-survival-earns-polish-presidents-recognition) during which the Polish government awarded my friend Walter Plywaski, a Holocaust survivor, the Knight's Cross of Merit, "in recognition of outstanding services to the Polish-American community in disseminating historical awareness on Polish and Jewish fates in the occupied Poland." The 6 [sepals](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepal) represent the star of David.
