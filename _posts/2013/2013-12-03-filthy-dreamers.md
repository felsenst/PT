The Honors program at the University of Central Florida has a documentary film class whose previous projects have been well-received. Now, they are crowdsourcing funding for [their latest project, "Filthy Dreamers"](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/filthy-dreamers?show_todos=true). This one is about antievolution efforts in Florida following the 1925 Scopes trial.

> In the late 1920's a controversy sparked about the teaching of evolution to women students at Florida State Women's College. Nearly 100 years later, public figures and activists are still trying to control curriculum in public schools, colleges and universities. The students enrolled in this Honors class through the University of Central Florida aim to educate and inform our viewers about the long history of censorship in the classrooms, the libraries and around the campus.
