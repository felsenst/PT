The bad news: Only 67&nbsp;% of Democrats accept evolution. The worse news: Only 43&nbsp;% of Republicans accept evolution. The very worst news: The Republicans are down 5&nbsp;% from 4 years ago. This, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center, as reported by CBS news in an [article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-belief-in-evolution-plummets-poll-reveals/) entitled "Republicans' belief in evolution plummets, poll reveals." 

More precisely, Pew asked whether "humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time, or humans and other living things have evolved over time." You may see the report, "Public's views on human evolution," [here](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/12/30/publics-views-on-human-evolution/).

Pew reports a number of "key findings," such as organizing the data as a function of religion; no surprises there. Approximately 1/3 of all adults agree "that humans and other living things have evolved over time and that evolution \[was\] due to natural processes," whereas approximately 1/4 of all adults believe that "\[a\] supreme being guided evolution." 4&nbsp;% "don't know," so altogether 60&nbsp;% of adults accept evolution. The breakdown by religion was equally unsurprising. Interestingly, however, across every demographic, slightly more people think that "\[nonhuman\] animals have evolved over time" than that "humans have evolved over time."

Finally, I use "accept" evolution, rather than Pew's and CBS's "believe in," because evolution &ndash; descent with modification &ndash; is a scientific fact and not a belief.
