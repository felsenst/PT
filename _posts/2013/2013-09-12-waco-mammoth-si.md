Someone who identified himself only as Profound Pharynx wrote the other day asking for our help in getting a paleontological resource, the [Waco Mammoth Site](http://www.waco-texas.com/cms-waco-mammoth/), designated a National Monument. Specifically, he asks that we sign a [petition]( https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/add-waco-mammoth-site-national-park-service-national-monument-executive-order/rz2mnmLV) asking the President to name the site as a National Monument by executive order. The petition must gather at least 100,000 signatures by October 11; as I write, it has 73 signatures, but in a few moments it will have 74.

Here is what Profound Pharynx asked us to publish:

> Please ask the President to add the Waco Mammoth Site to the National
> Park Service as a National Monument by way of executive order.  In a
> [2008 Special Resource Study]( http://planning.nps.gov/parkplans.cfm?ID=223), the NPS found the Waco Mammoth Site to be
> an ideal candidate for National Monument status. \[I looked over the [summary](http://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=442&amp;projectId=12000&amp;documentID=24485), and it seemed promising.\] The Waco Mammoth Site
> is one of the most important Ice Age paleontological sites in the
> country, and one of the few sites where visitors can see the fossil
> bones of extinct animals lying where they were when they died and were
> buried 50-70 thousand years ago. Admission to the National Parks Service
> in a city-led partnership with the City of Waco and Baylor University
> would pave the way for further excavation and discovery at the site
> while costing the NPS just a small amount per year. Despite overwhelming
> support from the NPS and the visiting public, Congress has twice failed
> to act on this matter.
> 
> The City of Waco, Baylor University, and the private non-profit Mammoth
> Foundation have done their best to protect and promote the site by
> building a state-of-the-art in-situ dig shelter and welcome center.
> Unfortunately, much-needed further development cannot proceed at the
> present time.  Extensive federal funding is not necessary to fix this
> situation.  Rather, admission to the National Parks Service will provide
> the site with the national and international exposure needed for Waco,
> Baylor, and the Mammoth Foundation to raise the funds themselves.  With
> the public awareness and notoriety that will come with National Monument
> status, the site will be able to gather the funds necessary to build
> educational facilities, paleontological laboratories, and exhibit
> spaces.  Only when these improvements are in place can excavation
> recommence so that the full extent, importance, and impact of the Ice
> Age discoveries in Waco becomes apparent to the world.

I could not find a website for the Mammoth Foundation, but if you feel an urge you may look them up in GuideStar [here](http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/20-1161717/waco-mammoth-foundation.aspx). A [news article](http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/waco-site-a-worthy-national-monument/nRhgR/) in the Austin Statesman says that it is "a nonprofit group put together by Waco residents, \[and\] has raised millions of dollars to turn the site into a 105-acre public park, which opened in late 2009 and features a visitor center, an enclosed dig shelter and a walking trail."
