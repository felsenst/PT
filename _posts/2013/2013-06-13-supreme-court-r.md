But they also ruled that cDNA sequences may be patented.  The argument is something like this:  DNA is found in nature, hence not patentable.  But cDNA, or DNA stripped of its introns, is not found in nature, hence potentially patentable. See Adam Liptak's [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/supreme-court-rules-human-genes-may-not-be-patented.html) in _The New York Times_.

The outcome means (or seems to mean) that Myriad Genetics will no longer have a monopoly on testing for the breast-cancer genes, BRCA-1 and -2. Liptak suggests that competition will now drive the cost of such tests down from the present price of around $3000.  Myriad's stock nevertheless had gone up at the time of Liptak's report.
