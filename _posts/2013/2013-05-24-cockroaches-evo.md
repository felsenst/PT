Not stated is whether they manage to lose weight, nor whether they still get cavities or develop diabetes. But a recent [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6135/972.full) in _Science_ shows that cockroaches evolved an aversion to glucose after glucose was used for a number of years as a poisoned bait. That is, the cockroaches developed an aversion to the bait rather than a resistance to the poison. The _Science_ article is kind of written in Greek


> In response to the anthropogenic assault of toxic baits, populations of the German cockroach have rapidly evolved an adaptive behavioral aversion to glucose (a phagostimulant component of baits). 


but _The New York Times_ has a nice [summary](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/science/a-bitter-sweet-shift-in-cockroach-defenses.html) and notes, almost as a throw-away, that the result might have application to diseases, such as malaria, that are spread by mosquitoes.

Memo to potential trolls: Yes, yes, we know&mdash;they are still cockroaches!!
