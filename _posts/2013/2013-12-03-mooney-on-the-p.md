Here's some reading material for you:  [A new article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/11/seven-evolutionary-reasons-people-deny-evolution) by Chris Mooney, posted at _Mother Jones_, argues that we have certain psychological dispositions that make it easier for us to accept religion than evolution.  Larry Moran [was not impressed](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2013/11/why-dont-people-accept-evolution.html) with the article.  [Neither was](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/chris-mooney-downplays-religion-as-a-cause-of-creationism/) Jerry Coyne.  But I think the article was a bit better than they suggest, and I make my case [in this post](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2013/12/04/mooney-on-the-psychology-of-evolution-denial/) over at EvolutionBlog.  Comments may be left there.  Enjoy!
