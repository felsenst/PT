Intelligent-design creationist Guillermo Gonzalez has been appointed assistant professor of physics at Ball State University, according to an [article](http://www.jconline.com/article/20130706/NEWS0501/307060025/Ball-State-hires-intelligent-design-leader-teach-astronomy) in jconline.com. Gonzalez is the author of _The Privileged Planet_ and was famously [denied tenure](/archives/2007/06/iowa-state-univ-1.html) at Iowa State University.  Gonzalez will teach two introductory astronomy courses, The Sun and Stars, and The Solar System.

Ball State has also come under fire recently following reports that another professor, Eric Hedin, [teaches a Boundaries of Science class](http://www.thestarpress.com/article/20130615/NEWS01/306150013/Eric-Hedin) whose curriculum allegedly includes intelligent-design creationism. The Star Press article, incidentally, notes that the university, not the professor, has the legal right to define the curriculum. Let us hope that they will watch Professors Gonzalez and Hedin closely.
