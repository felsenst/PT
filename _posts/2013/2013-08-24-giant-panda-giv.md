Professor Steve Steve reports that his distant relative Mei Xiang [ gave birth to a cub](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/23/214925907/mei-xiang-giant-panda-at-national-zoo-gives-birth-to-a-cub) at the National Zoo yesterday. NPR reports that the zoo did not know that the panda was pregnant until recently, when, according to Professor Steve Steve, she told her keepers that she "might be just a little bit pregnant." Reuters [reports](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/23/us-usa-life-panda-idUSBRE97M10Q20130823) that scientists will shortly perform a paternity test. You may see a webcam shot of the giant panda [here](http://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/webcams/giant-panda.cfm).
