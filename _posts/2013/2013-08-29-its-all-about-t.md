John (catshark) Pieret [analyzes](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2013/08/nothing-to-do-with-religion.html) profiles of attendees at the Disco 'Tute's [summer "institute"](http://www.discovery.org/csc/summerseminar/) on intelligent design. While the program is explicitly aimed at students so as to "...prepare students to make research contributions advancing the growing science of intelligent design (ID)"), at least some of the attendees are already active teachers in public schools. I remember Bill Dembski arguing for the recruitment of high school students 12 years ago on ARN somewhere; see [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/09/introduction-to.html) for a quotation from a now-dead link. The full profiles are [here](http://www.worldmag.com/2013/08/peeking_outside_the_darwin_cage/page1), in a religious publication. The comments there are fascinating. It's all about the science, right?
