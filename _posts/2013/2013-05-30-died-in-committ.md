According to NCSE's [scorecard](http://ncse.com/evolution/anti-evolution-anti-climate-science-legislation-scorecard-2013), that is what happened to most of 10 anti-science bills introduced in state legislatures. Most of the bills used the now traditional "strengths and weaknesses" or "academic freedom" ploys, but some would have allowed "teachers to 'intelligently explore' controversies and help wayward students 'develop critical thinking skills,'" as NCSE puts it.  Four bills attacked climate change in addition to evolution. None of the bills was enacted into law.  Unfortunately, a bill to repeal the "notorious" Louisiana Science Education Act also failed.
