(This is for the three people who don't read Sandwalk.)

Every once in a while one sees a takedown so powerful that it makes one smile for days. One such is in [the comment thread](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-idiots-view-genome-research.html?spref=fb) on a post on Sandwalk, Larry Moran's blog. In the comments Diogenes eviscerates an anonymous poster on Evolution News and Views, an arm of the Disco 'Tute, about a claim about 'junk' DNA. Read it and laugh at the 'Tooters.
