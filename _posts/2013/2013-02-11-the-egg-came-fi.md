I have been saying it for years: The transition from dinosaur (figuratively speaking) to chicken was gradual, but at some time we stopped calling it a dinosaur and started calling it a chicken. Or would have if we had been there. The chicken therefore emerged from an egg laid by a dinosaur.  Hence, the egg came first.  See Robert Krulwich's [article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/02/11/171706769/the-egg-makes-its-move-in-a-new-version-of-which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-e) on NPR and the splendid [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1a8pI65emDE) he links to if you do not believe me.
