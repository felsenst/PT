NCSE is ginning up to run webinar training sessions for folks interested in defending the teaching of honest science out in the field:

> The National Center for Science Education will soon present monthly online training sessions that will show you how to defend science education in your schools and your community. 

There's [a questionnaire](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7D5N7XZ) at Survey Monkey to gauge interests. I'm not (yet) sure of the registration procedure, though the questionnaire solicits the relevant info and an expression of interest in attending/participating.

Some years ago I attended a meatspace workshop at NCSE in Oakland aimed at (more or less) the same objective, and it was well worth the time. I'll be taking at least one of the webinars, too.
