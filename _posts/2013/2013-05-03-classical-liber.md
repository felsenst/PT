Stephen Dilley's new book, [_Darwinian Evolution And Classical Liberalism: Theories in Tension_,](http://www.amazon.com/Darwinian-Evolution-Classical-Liberalism-ebook/dp/B00CM6WUD0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367603032&amp;sr=1-1#_) is now available, at least on Kindle. Chapter 12 is by me; it's entitled, somehwat dully, "Classical Liberalism And Evolution." In it, I argue that evolution, far from undercutting the premises of classical liberalism, is at least compatible with them, and, as I think, provides a stronger foundation for them than any variety of creationism. But, as I contend at the outset, it doesn't much matter, because evolution is true. So if it's incompatible with libertarianism, then so much the worse for libertarianism. 

Chapter 11 is by my friend [Shawn Klein;](http://www.philosophyblog.com/2013/05/classical-liberalism-and-evolution.html) it's called, somewhat more interestingly, "Volitional Consciousness and Evolution." Other contributors include [Roger Masters](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rmasters/) and [Michael J. White. ](http://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=5253)
