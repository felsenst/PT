Those who know [John Searle's "Chinese Room" critique](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Chinese_room) of the possibility of genuine consciousness in artificial/machine intelligences [will enjoy this](http://fauxphilnews.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/john-searles-homunculus-announces-phased-retirement/):

> **John Searle's homunculus announces phased retirement**
> 
> After 54 years of teaching at Berkeley, the man inside John Searle's head has announced he will be entering a three-year phased retirement after the end of the current semester. The diminutive Zhu Tao made the announcement at a press conference Monday in a rare out-of-costume appearance.
> 
> At the conference Zhu said he is retiring from his current position in order to spend more time with Searle's family. "I have become quite attached to these people," Zhu said through a translator. "Although, admittedly, not being able to understand a word they say has limited the intimacy of our relationships."

> 
> While he expressed sadness at the end of an era, Zhu looked back with pride at his time inside John Searle's head. Zhu is popularly credited with sparking the shift away from brain-based cognition. Today that shift continues apace, with figures such as Andy Clark and David Chalmers outsourcing their thinking to call centers in India as part of a growing movement of philosophers who believe cognition can extend beyond the boundaries of one's skull.
