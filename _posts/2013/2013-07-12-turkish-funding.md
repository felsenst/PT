_Science_ [reports](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6142/114.2.full) today that Turkey's main science-funding agency denied a grant to a workshop on the grounds that "evolution is a controversial subject." The purpose of the workshop was "to expose Turkish biology students to population genetics, game theory, and evolutionary modeling." The organizers of the workshop had asked for approximately $18,000 (US) to cover the cost of students' lodging and speakers' travel. The workshop will go on, with private donors contributing the $18,000.

A spokesman for the funding agency, Tübitak, told _Science_ that the proposal was rejected on its merits, despite [wording in the rejection letter](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/07/turkish-scientists-see-new-evide.html) that 


> evolution is both nationally and universally a controversial subject. ... It is difficult to regard it as an activity on which a consensus can be reached. ... Since evolution is still a debated issue, the degree to which the organizers represent the community/country is very questionable.

 

The organizers of the workshop 


> are calling this \[rejection\] the first open admission of a bias against evolutionary biology by Turkey's conservative government. The government began blocking educational evolution websites in 2011, and recently TÜBİTAK stopped publishing books on evolution, a decision it claimed was based on copyright issues,


according to the _Science_ article.
