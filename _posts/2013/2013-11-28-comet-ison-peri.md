Nice video [here](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/193909261.html), along with a sky map telling you where to look in the early morning. Instructions for viewing it in daylight [here](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/Spot-Comet-ISON-at-Perihelion-233011581.html) &ndash; wear sunglasses and take their advice to use a stationary object, not your thumb, to block the sun.  And latest images [here](http://www.nasa.gov/ison/).  I am going out now with my trusty camera and looking for a lamp post, but it may be too close to the sun already.

Update:  Here is a remarkable picture from the Nasa site above, taken on November 25.
