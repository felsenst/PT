The paper [Selective bird predation on the peppered moth: the last experiment of Michael Majerus](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/4/609.full) is one of the most downloaded and cited articles in _Biology Letters_ in 2012.  As Bruce Grant, one of the coauthors, said to me privately, "It is encouraging that the _Biston_ evidence, presented by those of us who actually know it, is being widely read." _Biston_ is the genus of the peppered moth, _B. betularia_.

PT has covered a controversy concerning the peppered moth [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/03/why-the-peppere.html).  [Michael Majerus](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/mike-majerus-pa.html), a lepidopterist and expert on melanism and the peppered moth, died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2009.   Nick Matzke covered Majerus's last experiment [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/02/selective-bird.html).
