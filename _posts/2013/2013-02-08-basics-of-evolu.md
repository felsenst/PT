[Dennis Venema](http://twu.ca/academics/science/biology/faculty/venema/), an evolutionary creationist, senior fellow of [BioLogos](http://biologos.org/blog), and associate professor and chair of the biology department of Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia, is starting an [elementary introduction to evolution at BioLogos](http://biologos.org/blog/evolution-basics-a-new-introductory-course-on-evolutionary-biology). The series of posts will be aimed at 

> ... just average folks who would like to learn more, but need to start at the beginning and work up slowly - not jump in halfway through, with technical terms and jargon flying around. They need a context for the discussion. They need to explore the basics,  first, before building on that understanding to explore the finer details.

Venema is a bright, knowledgeable guy who has strongly criticized the intelligent design movement and old earth creationists like [Reasons to Believe](http://www.reasons.org/). He comments here occasionally, and I'll be interested to see the response to his series. It's a worthy effort, and I wish him well with it.
