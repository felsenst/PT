<big>[_Hyla versicolor_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_tree_frog) -- gray tree frog. Mr. Garrison writes, "BTW, the frog can change its skin color somewhat -- they used to hang around my elephant ear plants a lot when I was drip-irrigating them (setting up a mini-biome.)  I'd often look out and see one of the frogs clinging to the
outside of a window.  But sometimes they are dark colored like the one in the
[first photo](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/10/hyla-versicolor.html), and sometimes white (but always with the yellow patches on the rear legs)."</big>
