<big>[Ice stalagmite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite#Ice_stalagmites).  My furnace drowned during the recent floods in Boulder, and I replaced it with a high-efficiency furnace. The furnace discharges into a plastic pipe, which the technicians ran up the old flue. We are nearing the end of the first cold snap of the year, with nighttime temperatures running below 0 &deg;F, and the condensation from the pipe evidently caused the ice stalagmite on the roof.</big>
