The [National Center for Science Education](http://ncse.com/) announced that its executive director, Eugenie Scott, will [retire](http://ncse.com/news/2013/05/ncses-scott-to-retire-0014832) at the end of the year:

> NCSE's executive director Eugenie C. Scott announced on May 6, 2013,
> that she was planning to retire by the end of the year, after more
> than twenty-six years at NCSE's helm. "It's a good time to retire,
> with our new climate change initiative off to a strong start and with
> the staff energized and excited by the new challenges ahead," she
> commented. "The person who replaces me will find a strong staff, a
> strong set of programs, and a strong board of directors."

NCSE continues,


> During Scott's time at NCSE, she was honored with no fewer than eight
> honorary degrees as well as the Public Welfare Medal from the National
> Academy of Science, the inaugural Stephen Jay Gould Prize from the
> Society for the Study of Evolution, the Public Service Award from the
> National Science Board, and the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility
> Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

> "It's not going to be easy to fill the shoes of someone who has done
> so much to make NCSE into the respected and admired organization it
> is," remarked Brian Alters, the president of NCSE's board of
> directors. "We look forward with working with Genie to find the best
> possible successor." A job announcement is now available; members and
> friends of NCSE are encouraged to spread the word that what Scott once
> described as "the best job in the world" will soon be open.

> Science Insider (May 6, 2013) [reported](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/05/eugenie-scott-to-retire-from-us-.html) on the announcement, quoting
> Kenneth R. Miller of Brown University as saying of Scott, "She's
> incomparable, irreplaceable, and indispensable," and Sean B. Carroll
> of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as saying, "The entire
> scientific community, legions of teachers, and millions of students
> owe her a great debt for her dedication and passionate advocacy. She
> has established a remarkable legacy at NCSE."

I could not agree more -- we all owe Dr. Scott our gratitude for her tireless and eloquent defense of science and rational thinking.
