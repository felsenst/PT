The correspondence of Alfred Russel Wallace is [now online](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/wallacelettersonline). And [here's an interesting "interview"](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23103-wallace-wonders-of-nature-have-been-solace-of-my-life.html) with Wallace, with Wallace's answers drawn from that correspondence.
