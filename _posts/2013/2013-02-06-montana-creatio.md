As Matt noted above, one of the creationist so-called "academic freedom" bills was filed in the Montana state legislature. Now [the Sensuous Curmudgeon reports](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/montanas-2013-creationism-bill-tabled/) that the bill has been tabled in committee, whatever that means. In that post SC also has a video of some of the testimony at the committee hearing on the bill, noting that the proposer, Representative Clayton Fiscus, was the only speaker in support while a couple of dozen professors, teachers, and citizens testified in opposition. It's worth watching both for the testimony in opposition and for the almost sad ignorance and confusion of Representative Fiscus. I genuinely wonder how he navigates through life given his evident inability to think coherently. if  he's the best the Disco Tute can come up with to sponsor their bills, they're in deeper trouble than I thought.

That video is edited from the full hearing, and another set of excerpts consisting mostly of speakers' identifications is on [NCSE's YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX9QYMWsFzY). It does not include Representative Fiscus' remarks. I wouldn't be surprised if video of the full hearing including all testimony is somewhere, but I haven't looked for it.
