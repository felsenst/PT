**UPDATE**: [Video of the oral arguments](http://www.ohiochannel.org/MediaLibrary/Media.aspx?fileId=138278) is now up.

Oral arguments before the Ohio Supreme Court on the termination of John Freshwater's contract as a middle school science teacher in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, [are scheduled](http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/Clerk/calendar/) for the morning of Wednesday, February 27. Freshwater's case is second on the schedule. Fifteen minutes of oral arguments are allotted to each side in each case, and I don't know how long the break between cases is, so Freshwater's case will be heard sometime after 0930 EST (1430 UT). Oral arguments will be live streamed on [The Ohio Channel](http://www.ohiochannel.org/MediaLibrary/Collection.aspx?collectionId=108262&amp;action=clear), and I was told by an administrator at the Court that video of the arguments should be archived at the same site that evening.

The documents in the Court's review are [here](http://www.supremecourtofohio.gov/clerk/ecms/resultsbycasenumber.asp?type=3&amp;year=2012&amp;number=0613&amp;myPage=searchbycasenumber.asp). The core documents are Freshwater's Merit Brief ([PDF here]()) and the District's Merit Brief ([PDF here](http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=714967.pdf)). In addition, Steve and Jenifer Dennis, the National Center for Science Education, the Secular Student Alliance, the American Humanist Association, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State have filed _amicus curiae_ briefs, all available at the general documents link above.

Recall that two lower courts, the [Knox County Court of Common Pleas](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/10/freshwater-appe.html) and the [Ohio Fifth District Court of Appeals](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/03/freshwater-appe-3.html), both ruled against Freshwater. I still have no idea why the Ohio Supreme Court accepted the case for review, particularly in view of [the bait and switch](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/09/freshwater-the-11.html) Freshwater's attorneys pulled on the Court.

I suggest that interested folks preview a couple of the [archived oral argument videos](http://www.ohiochannel.org/MediaLibrary/Collection.aspx?collectionId=108262&amp;action=clear) to get a feel for how the Court operates. In general, attorneys for both sides get to start their presentations but are rather quickly interrupted by questions from members of the Court.
