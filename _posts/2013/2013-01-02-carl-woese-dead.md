I just heard word that evolutionary microbiologist [Carl Woese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Woese) has [died](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/science/carl-woese-dies-discovered-lifes-third-domain.html).  Woese is probably most famous for defining the [Archaea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea), the "third domain of life".  

Intelligent design proponents have touted Woese's ideas about horizontal gene transfer as a challenge to evolutionary theory, [even claiming](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=722) that Woese argued there were multiple, independent origins of organisms.  This was wrong, of course.  
Almost exactly a decade ago, I asked Woese to give his thoughts on his work and ID.  I leave you with some of his comments:

> It's basically correct to say that I do not challenge common ancestry _per se_ but rather the concept that
> there was a single common ancestor cell or organism that gave rise to the
> three cellular domains of life.
> 
> In a way my theory is more of a problem for creationists
> and their ilk than the old way of looking at things -- though
> those folks do not seem to sense this yet.  Special creation
> starts with a given type of form that may or may not change but
> in any case remains "true" to its original character.
> "Intelligent design" seems to see different mechanisms
> being designed individually, just as an inventor or engineer
> would do.  Well, in my theory none of this is the case.
> 
> I have no trouble with a claim
> to the effect that God set the world up so that
> it progressed in an evolutionary fashion.  That
> would affect my work no more than the belief
> that God's world was a mathematical world affected
> Newton's work; one can scientifically procede the
> same way with or without the assumption.  And
> creationist or intelligent design views will
> be back where they belong, in the realm of
> (immature) religion.
