Most PT readers doubtless already know that an organization called "Citizens for Objective Public Education" (COPE) has [sued a range of Kansas defendants](http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/COPE_v_Kansas_BOE/20130926_Complaint.pdf) (PDF of complaint), including the Kansas State Board of Education, alleging that the [Next Generation Science Standards](http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards) are unconstitutional, in that they "...will have the effect of causing Kansas public schools to establish and endorse a non-theistic religious worldview ... in violation of the Establishment, Free Exercise, and Speech Clauses of the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment" (pp. 1-2)" (quoted in the NCSE article linked below).

NCSE has the [full story here](http://ncse.com/news/2013/09/anti-ngss-lawsuit-filed-kansas-0015078). I note with parochial interest that [Robert Lattimer](http://www.sciohio.org/seaospk.htm), a chemist, is involved in COPE. Lattimer was a leading light in SEAO, the [American Family Association project](https://www.au.org/church-state/may-2002-church-state/featured/insidious-design) to shove intelligent design creationism into the Ohio science standards in the early 2000's.
