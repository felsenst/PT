A number of people across the web have posted their memories of where they were the day President Kennedy was assassinated. Mine is short: I was at sea [aboard the ship](http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/USG-03-J.aspx) of the U.S. Navy that he visited less than a week before he was shot.
