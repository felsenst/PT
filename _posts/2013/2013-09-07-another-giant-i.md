I became aware of science fiction sometime around 1950, when the "commercial club" in my tiny village--my dad, who managed the lumberyard, Butch Holdredge, who owned a grocery store, two saloon owners whose names I don't recall, Mr. Hanenberger, who owned the hardware store, the Laudon brothers, who owned the grain elevator, and the village banker, Merle Comingore--arranged for free movies to be shown on a sheet hung on the side of the township building outdoors on summer Saturday nights. Typically, the itinerant projectionist, who drove up from Winona, showed a cartoon (Mighty Mouse was a favorite), a serial, always with a cliff-hanger, and a two-reel feature. One summer the serial was a [Buck Rogers saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers_(serial)) created 10 years earlier. I was entranced by it.

I remember seeing [Destination Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_Moon_(film)) in a real theater in its first release in 1950 (admission 14 cents). I read the science fiction pulps--Amazing Stories, Astounding Science-Fiction--when I could find them. All that was part of the background that led me to [work in aerospace](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/remembering-apo.html) years ago.

Now the last of the founding giants of modern science fiction, Frederick Pohl, [has died](http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2013/09/frederik-pohl-nov-26-1919sept-2-2013/). RIP.
