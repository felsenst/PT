One is reminded of the [Black Knight scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eMkth8FWno) from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The limbs keep being lopped off.

Stephen Meyer's "Darwin's Doubt" has taken a beating from scientists who have reviewed it. Nick Matzke (recently Ph.D.'d and on his way to postdochood in Knoxville), in [Meyer's Hopeless Monster, Part II](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/06/meyers-hopeless-2.html), eviscerated Meyer's understanding of phylogenetics, among other things (see also [Luskin's Hopeless Monster](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/06/luskins-hopeles.html)). Don Prothero, in [Stephen Meyer's Fumbling Bumbling Amateur Cambrian Follies](http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/08/28/stephen-meyers-fumbling-bumbling-amateur-cambrian-follies/) did the same to Meyer's presentation of paleontology. John Pieret has a [list of critical reviews](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2013/09/open-wide.html).

The most ambitious effort is on [Smilodon't Retreat](http://www.skepticink.com/smilodonsretreat/2013/07/09/darwins-doubt-a-review/), the blog of an [anonymous scientist](http://www.skepticink.com/smilodonsretreat/about/). The reviewer is slogging through the book section by section. Eight posts are up and we're just into Chapter 1 (of 20). Go there, read, comment, and cheer the reviewer on.
