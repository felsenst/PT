This ought to be good. [In a comment](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/04/william-dembski.html#comment-303256), diogeneslamp0 alerts us to a live chat on that topic scheduled for tomorrow (Tuesday) on the [Facebook page of AIG's Answers Magazine](https://www.facebook.com/AnswersMagazine?group_id=0). Diogeneslamp0 notes

> On the topic of how kangaroos got to Australia after Noah's Flood: at 2pm tomorrow, April 16 Answers in Genesis will hold a live chat at Facebook about AIG's marvelous [Super-fast Ice-Age Timeline and Map](http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v8/n2/ice-age-biblical-history) (which has the Ice Age lasting from about ~2220 to ~2115 BC, and all recorded human civilization post-2100 BC). I predict that any pointed questions they receive will be deleted quickly and permanently, so if you want some entertainment you will have to monitor it live. You may want to copy and archive any choice questions they receive before they're deleted.

I presume that AIG's "2:00 pm" is Eastern Daylight Time (=1800 GMT). Diogeneslamp0 has some representative questions one might ask at the linked comment.
