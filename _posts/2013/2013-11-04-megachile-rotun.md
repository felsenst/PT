<big>[_Megachile rotundata_](https://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid=18357) -- alfalfa leafcutting bee.  Mr. Rossi adds, "I studied the mating behavior of these solitary bees for my PhD. This is a female sitting inside of a styrofoam nesting block, which is a styrofoam cube with many long tunnels running through it. The back of the block was resting against the glass inside of a glass tank, so I pointed my camera at one of the nesting holes from the outside of the tank."</big>
