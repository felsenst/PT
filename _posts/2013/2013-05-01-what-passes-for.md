Snopes.com yesterday [verified](http://www.snopes.com/photos/signs/sciencetest.asp) that a "science" test (below the fold) given to 4th graders at a sectarian school is in fact real. Answers in Genesis, meanwhile, [vilifies](http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2013/04/30/atheists-attack-christian-school) anyone who objects to such nonsense being taught as science, calling them "intolerant atheists" who "viciously attack \[a\] Christian school."

The child's father says that he is trying to deprogram the child (my locution, not his) and that she will not attend the school next year. As for me, I wonder why he is waiting so long.
