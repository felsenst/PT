The Mt. Vernon Board of Education's attorneys have filed a [memo in opposition](http://www.supremecourtofohio.gov/clerk/ecms/resultsbycasenumber.asp?type=3&amp;year=2012&amp;number=0613&amp;myPage=searchbycasenumber.asp) to John Freshwater's motion to the Ohio Supreme Court to reconsider his case. The memo essentially argues that Freshwater has nothing new in his motion for reconsideration, no new evidence or arguments, but is merely a rehash of his previous claims, and therefore it should be denied. It argues on the same grounds on which the Court made its decision, that the case for Freshwater's insubordination is sufficient by itself to uphold Freshwater's termination.
