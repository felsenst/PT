E.O. Wilson says you can be successful as a scientist without math. Well, maybe. But, you can improve your chances of success if you take a breath, let go of your fear of math, and take some time to learn it. I think it is really quite wonderful. Oh, and if you aren't sure about where to start, there just happens to be a workshop for Mathematics in Biology. Yes, yes, go sign up!!

<div markdown="block" style="margin-bottom: 14pt; margin-top: 14pt;">
The workshop is intended to broaden the scientific perspective of young researchers
(primarily junior faculty, postdocs, and senior graduate students) in mathematical biology and to encourage interactions with other
scientists.

<div markdown="block" style="margin-bottom: 14pt; margin-top: 14pt;">
Workshop
activities include plenary talks and poster sessions, as well as group 
discussions on issues relevant to mathematical biologists. Several 
abstracts will be chosen
for short talks as well as poster presentations.&nbsp;Limited funding is available on a competitive basis.

We
cordially invite young mathematical biologists to participate. For full
consideration, please apply by May 1, 2013. To apply, click this link**&nbsp;**[**http://www.mbi.osu.edu/wyrmb/wyrmb2013.html**](http://www.mbi.osu.edu/wyrmb/wyrmb2013.html)
