<big>[_Odocoileus virginianus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_deer) -- [leucistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucism) piebald white-tailed deer, Kiptopeke State Park, Cape Charles, Va., 11 October, 2013. Mr. Shackleton adds, "I was up there for four days for fall bird migration, but constant rain meant that this was the only shot of note for the entire trip."</big>
