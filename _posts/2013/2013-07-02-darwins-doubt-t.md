Years ago, someone gave me a book on child-rearing, and I noticed afterward that it was on _The New York Times_ bestseller list. I mentioned the fact to my father, an expert on child-rearing, and his only comment was, "That's not why it is lousy." My father would no doubt feel vindicated right about now: Stephen Meyer's book, [Darwin's Doubt](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/06/meyers-hopeless-2.html), will be on the _Times_'s [bestseller list](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html) this coming Sunday, July 7.

**Acknowledgment.** Thanks to Alert Reader for pointing out this depressing fact.

**Update, July 5**:  As a commenter has pointed out, _Darwin's Doubt_ will not appear on the [July 14 list](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2013-07-14/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html). The book is evidently a flash in the pan&mdash;unless they moved it to the fiction section. Advance orders were evidently vigorously promoted, but no one is actually reading the book, which we may consider a blessing.
