In May I encouraged everyone to think of how to explain their research using the [most common 1000 words in American English](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/). There were a lot of [excellent submissions](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/05/challenge-resea.html)! <br />
<br />
Now, take a look at this winning poster from a team of Penn State researchers entitled, "Powering Your Car with Sunlight"! The researchers were allowed one word in addition to the list of 1000 common words: energy. <br />

Read more about their effort [here](http://news.psu.edu/story/282665/2013/07/25/research/penn-state-team-wins-department-energy-poster-competition), and check out the other poster entries [here](http://www.energyfrontier.us/posters). <br /><br />Yes, we can more _efficiently_ explain our research when we use language that is more technical than the 1000 most common words. But I will argue that we can more _effectively_ communicate our research when we take the time to consider the minimal level of technical jargon needed to convey the underlying principles.
