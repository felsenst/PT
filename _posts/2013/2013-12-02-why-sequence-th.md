I was excited to learn today that there is genome sequence for the West Indian manatee ([_Trichechus manatus_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/10467))!! A friend wondered why I was so excited, asking, "Is it evolutionarily interesting?"<br />
<br />
Well, first off, I've always been fascinated with manatees: they are so defenseless, and yet grow so large that they are rarely predated on. They are, however, especially susceptible to [human-made water vessels](http://www.livescience.com/19639-manatee-hearing-boats.html). I am excited for their genome because I've always loved them. But, they are also pretty evolutionarily awesome.<br />

<br />
**1.&nbsp;****Manatees are more closely related to elephants than they are to dolphins or whales.**<br />
The manatee&nbsp;and the bottlenosed dolphin are approximately [100 million years diverged from each other](http://timetree.org/index.php?taxon_a=manatee&amp;amp;taxon_b=bottlenosed+dolphin&amp;amp;submit=Search). The manatee is classified under the [Afrotheria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&amp;amp;id=311790&amp;amp;lvl=3&amp;amp;keep=1&amp;amp;srchmode=1&amp;amp;unlock), which also includes elephants, hyraxes, and aardvarks, while the dolphin is classified as [Laurasiatheria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&amp;amp;id=314145&amp;amp;lvl=3&amp;amp;keep=1&amp;amp;srchmode=1&amp;amp;unlock), which also includes the red panda, hippos, horses, rhinoceros, and bears. You can click on the links above for more detailed lists of the species included in each group.<br />
<br />
Although about 100 million years separate manatees from dolphins, the manatee and elephant are only separated by about [61 million years](http://timetree.org/index.php?found_taxon_a=9777%7Cmanatee&amp;amp;found_taxon_b=9783%7Celephant). Unlike dolphins, but like elephants, manatees have toenails:<br />

**2. Manatees convergently (independently) evolved the ability to live under water**<br />
Unlike other mammals that live primarily in the water (whales and dolphins), the manatee (and [dugong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugong)) does not breath air through a blowhole on top of its head. Instead, manatees breath through their nostrils. How cool is that?<br />
<br />

Additionally, manatees independently evolved flippers and wide tails.<br />
<br />
Manatees also convergently lost most of their hair (although this isn't unique to water-dwelling mammals as many terrestrial mammals lost most of their hair too, including pigs, naked mole rats, and humans). I wonder whether similar genes are involved (disrupted?) to result in the loss of hair across these mammals?<br />
<br />
**3. Manatees have a much lower metabolic rate than expected for their body mass.**<br />
Manatees are fairly sedentary, and have a low metabolic rate ([0.36 times the predicted rate for placental mammals](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30155787?uid=3739560&amp;amp;uid=2129&amp;amp;uid=2&amp;amp;uid=70&amp;amp;uid=4&amp;amp;uid=3739256&amp;amp;sid=21103042710097)). Dolphins have a much higher metabolic rate, but a similar expected lifespan as manatees (approximately 50-60 years, to my understanding). So, it will be fascinating to investigate how genomes differ between fspecies with similar generation times, but very different metabolic rates.<br />
