**Update**, January 27:  Phil Plait reports [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/01/25/colorado_antiscience_bill_to_allow_teaching_of_creationism_is_doa.html) that the bill almost certainly will not make it out of committee.

Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy reports [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/01/22/creationism_in_the_classroom_colorado_lawmakers_considering_academic_freedom.html) on the latest creationism bill in Colorado. As always, the bill is disguised as an academic freedom bill but, as Plait says, questions evolution, cloning, and global warming and omits, say, religion and literature:

> If this were really about academic freedom, why is it so specific? Why not include all fields of science, instead of just those three? In fact, why not include all academic fields? I'd be fascinated to see literature, art, and math added to that. Or religious study...how about supplementary texts that show the contradictions in the Bible? I wonder how that would go over. \[Ellipsis in original.\]


Me?  I do not wonder at all.
