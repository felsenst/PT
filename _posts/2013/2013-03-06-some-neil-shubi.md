Neil Shubin has been out and about speaking on behalf of his recent book, [The Universe Within](http://www.randomhouse.com/book/166493/the-universe-within-by-neil-shubin), in a variety of venues. He summarizes his theme [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfp4Ci1b0TI). And as dessert, there's [this short one on _Tiktaalik_](http://www.youtube.com/embed/yvDQCa7rleI) from the [Royal Institution channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRoyalInstitution?annotation_id=channel%3A5122bcce-0-2b0e-9082-47d7bdc088e&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=yvDQCa7rleI).
