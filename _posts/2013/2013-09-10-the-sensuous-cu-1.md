Those who don't follow [The Sensuous Curmudgeon](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/) miss some great stuff. His latest is [Discovery Institute's New Form of Proof](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/discovery-institutes-new-form-of-proof/). It has a handy list of nine tactics the Disco Dancers use, with links to supporting material, and then adds a tenth, ""You're afraid to debate me, so I win!" SC comments 

> Despite the fact that the Discoveroids have no evidence and no theory that challenges evolution (or any other science), they demand endless debates over their empty and valueless rubbish. And when no one pays any attention to them, they declare victory. It's quite sad, really. But it probably impresses their generous patrons, who keep the cash flowing.

Maybe if they offered a $250K prize [like Kent Hovind](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind.html) they'd get a better response. Surely [Howard Ahmanson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Ahmanson,_Jr.) can afford a measly $250K.
