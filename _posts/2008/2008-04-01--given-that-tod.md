Given that today really is April 1st, let me start by saying that although Behe is a fool, this post isn't a joke. Everything you're about to read is real. This is the third part of my post on the summary judgment decision in the California Creationist Case. [Part 1](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/04/summary_judgment_in_california.php) is here, and [part 2 is here](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/04/summary_judgment_in_the_califo.php).

It would seem that Mike Behe has, once again, managed to shoot an own goal in the courtroom. The last time that he was an expert witness, during the Dover case, the judge quoted extensively from Behe's testimony, but not in a way that he particularly liked. Ultimately, it seems that he scored more points for his opponents than he did for his friends. He's also an expert witness in the California Creationism Case, and he seems to have once again managed to put the ball right through the wrong goal.

Behe's contribution to the pro-science side of the case appears on page 40 of [the written order](http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acsi-stearns/msjruling_033108.pdf):
