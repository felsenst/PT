I really should have loved [Michael Shermer’s _The Mind of The Market_,](http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Market-Compassionate-Competitive-Evolutionary/dp/0805078320/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1203290663&amp;amp;sr=8-1) because I am not only a libertarian but also fascinated by evolution and its scientific, economic, and philosophical implications. Moreover, I believe sociobiology can provide extremely important insights that offer a grounding for political philosophy on a genuine, objective human nature. And yet I found the book disappointing and even unconvincing. It is chock full of the hasty generalizations and oversimplifications that have led so many people to keep sociobiology at arm’s length. A good science-based defense of libertarianism will have to be much more rigorous than this.
