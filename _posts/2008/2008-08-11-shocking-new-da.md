[This news comes via PTer and historian of science John Lynch](http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2008/08/a_precious_historical_find.php).  I don't know what to think about this, it contradicts everything I used to think about Darwin, but honesty demands that the public and the scholarly world be informed of the uncomfortable facts.

> [Amazing letter](http://sneerreview.blogspot.com/2008/05/darwin-exposed.html) from Charles Darwin to Klara PÃ¶lzl, one that likely to change Darwin scholarship for the future. Written in 1881, a year before his death, Darwin could clearly see the vast implications of his life's work for Twentieth century thought. I'm going to have to take some time to digest this before I comment.
