Today we sat in on a conference call with the _Expelled_ frauds.  [PZ has his story up](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/i_always_aim_to_misbehave.php), and others will probably follow.  However, some people, including the producers of _Expelled_, have already taken to accuse us of [crashing their call](http://www.thinkingchristian.net/?p=1310), much like the lies about PZ crashing the _Expelled_ screening.

This is false.  We got an explicit invitation yesterday from _Expelled_'s media relations firm to participate, note to whom the invitation is addressed.

> Subject: INVITE: Live teleconference with BEN STEIN of Expelled<br />
> Date: Thu, 27 Mar 2008 13:45:24 -0400<br />
> From: Schlicht, Stacy (LAN-RCN) &lt;\[removed\]@rogersandcowan.com&gt;<br />
> To: thecrew@pandasthumb.org
> 
> **JOIN BEN STEIN TOMORROW, _Friday, March 28 at 1:00 pm. PST_ for an 
> exclusive, invitation-only LIVE press teleconference!**

Some crew members got multiple invitations, including the one above and one at the personal site.    PZ, however, was not one of them, despite the amount of (bad) press he has been able to generate for the frauds.  I guess they purposely excluded his personal email from the list.  However, they apparently forgot that PZ is a crew member, when they sent us our invitation.  It's incompetence all the way down.

The full invitation, minus the press quotes, is below the fold.
