Anne Minard of National Geographic News [**writes on July 9th**](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/07/080709-evolution-fish.html) 


> The discovery of a missing link in the evolution of bizarre flatfishes—each of which has both eyes on the same side of its head—**could give intelligent design advocates a sinking feeling**.
> 
> CT scans of 50-million-year-old fossils have revealed an intermediate species between primitive flatfishes (with eyes on both sides of their heads) and the modern, lopsided versions, which include sole, flounder, and halibut.
> 
> **So the change happened gradually, in a way consistent with evolution via natural selection**—not suddenly, as researchers once had little choice but to believe, the authors of the new study say.
> ...
> Though known for their odd eye arrangement, no flatfish start life that way. Each is born symmetrical, with one eye on each side of its skull.
> 
> As a flatfish develops from a larva to a juvenile, one eye migrates up and over the top of the head, coming to rest in its adult position on the opposite side of the skull.
> ...
> Palmer added that the new work is "a fantastic paper" that helps resolve a mystery "that's bedeviled evolutionary biologists for more than a century.
> 
> "It's really been a major, major puzzle to evolutionary biologists."

As expected, the Magisterium of Intelligent Design was quick to condemn the finding as simply [**floundering around**](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/07/national_geographic_uses_fish.html), while the Institute of Creation Research has a [**turbot-charged attack on the finding, pointing out that flatfish are sole-ly members of the flatfish 'kind,'**](http://www.icr.org/article/3964/) and putting National Geographic in it's [**plaice**](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-flatfish.html).
