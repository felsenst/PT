Our friends at Florida Citizens for Science mention some good news in Florida:

[Make that two for the science standards](http://blogs.tampabay.com/schools/2008/02/make-that-two-f.html) - A second Board of Education member has come out in favor of solid science education.

> Concerning the proposed resolution and the teaching of alternative theories, he asked the board, “what theories are you advocating being presented in the scientific curriculum?”
> 
> After a pause, Hancock replied, “I don’t think you are going to get that answer.”
> 
> Broen said, “since the resolution states there are other theories to be presented to the student, yet the board members have failed to produce them, then it seems this resolution must be discarded.”

Someone is realizing that there are no alternative theories...
