Michael Shermer of _Scientific American_fame has a new book out (which will be arriving in the mail soon, I hope) about evolution and economics, called [_The Mind of The Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, And Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics_.](http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Market-Compassionate-Competitive-Evolutionary/dp/0805078320/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201539993&amp;sr=8-1) His theme is how the market, like evolution, is a process of spontaneous order—a “self-organized emergent order.” He read an excerpt from the book and commented on it at the Cato Institute this month, and [here’s a video excerpt](http://www.tomgpalmer.com/archives/042398.php) from that talk. You can watch the entire event [here.](http://www.cato.org/event.php?eventid=4297)
