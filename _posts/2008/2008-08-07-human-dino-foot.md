We don't have enough geology around this joint, so here's some elsewhere.

Folks have undoubtedly seen the claim by "Dr." Carl Baugh that a human footprint has been found with a dino print partly overlapping it.  [Gary Hurd has done a nice analysis](http://stonesnbones.blogspot.com/2008/08/carl-baughs-latest-fake.html) of a decent photo of the specimen and (surprise!} concludes that it's a fake.  Gary even identifies signs that suggest how the specimen's patina was faked.  Go and read Gary's writeup.

Joe Meert also has [a nice post up](http://scienceantiscience.blogspot.com/2008/08/dr-ron-carlson-takes-over-for-kent.html) on a guy who appears to be Kent Hovind's clone, "Dr." Ron Carlson.  Carlson makes absolute hash of geological dating and the history of science, and Joe does a nice job on him.  I doubt, though, that Carlson will answer Joe's email.
