An interesting new paper is just out today in [PLoS ONE.](http://www.plosone.org/doi/pone.0002808)  You recall the announcement a few years back that [soft tissue that resembled organic tissue had been isolated from a _Tyrannosaurus_ femur](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/04/dino-blood-redu.html).  This started off a huge controversy in the field (and beyond)--researchers disagreeing with each other whether the structures seen were indeed blood cells and vessels; creationists crowing about how this finding represented "proof" that the earth was indeed young and dinosaurs had existed just a few thousand years ago; and of course, talk of cloning and DNA analysis.  On the side of "soft tissue = dino blood" were findings that reported identification of the iron-containing protein heme (potentially from the red blood cells) and morphology of cells and vessels similar to that seen in modern-day ostriches and emu.  However, the new paper by Kaye _et al_. provides an alternative explanation:  that the structures aren't actual vessels and cells, but are instead iron-rich bacterial biofilms.
