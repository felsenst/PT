There's a [very interesting article](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/beavers-gone-bad/) over at Uncommon Descent about beavers, and the things that they do. I'm not entirely sure why they posted the article - Barry seems to be trying to make the point that because Beavers clearly can commit criminal acts but just as clearly can't form criminal intent, their brains are different from humans, and there's therefore something "non-materialist" and special about the human brain. I'd like to take a look at the same story, but with a slightly different focus.

Here's [the story](http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=10009):
</p>

> Green campaigners called in police after discovering an illegal logging site in a nature reserve - and rounded up a gang of beavers.  
> <br />
> <br />Environmentalists found 20 neatly stacked tree trunks and others marked for felling with notches at the beauty-spot at Subkowy in northern Poland.  
> <br />
> <br />But police followed a trail left where one tree had been dragged away - and found a beaver dam right in the middle of the river.   A police spokesman said: "The campaigners are feeling pretty stupid. There's nothing more natural than a beaver."

Let's look at this story from the perspective of detecting design. That's a topic that's particularly relevant right now, given that Dembski himself has [recently abandoned](http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2008/12/04/vindication/), then [abandoned his abandonment of](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/reinstating-the-explanatory-filter/), the [explanatory filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanatory_filter).
