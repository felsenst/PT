Professor Peter Olofsson is a prominent mathematician, expert in probability, mathematical statistics and related fields (in particular, he has recently authored an outstanding textbook on probability and statistics).  In a new essay Olofsson offers a devastating critique of Dembski's and Behe's mishandling of probabilistic and statistical concepts in their attempts to utilize these powerful mathematical tools to support intelligent design "theory."  Olofsson provides a superb analysis of the fallacy of Dembski's treatment of the Caputo case, reveals Dembski's distortion of Bayesian approach, and offers strong mathematical arguments against Behe's latest book.
The full text of Olofsson's essay is available at [Talk Reason](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/chanceprob.cfm).
