Well the school is starting up again, and this blog will be slower than usual for a while until the authors get into the swing of things.

On my side of things, I have an upgrade planned for site now that Movable Type 4.21 has been released.  I'm currently running it on [my blog](http://dererumnatura.us/) and will implement it when I'm satisfied with it and have enough time on a weekend.

I've also revealed [a secret project](http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2008/08/test-away.html) that I've been toying with off and on for a few months: pre-submission comment validation.  I hope to enable this technology on PT, to help out those of you who find writing valid markup difficult.  However, I need y'all to go give [it a hard time](http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2008/08/test-away.html) to find the bugs.
