<p class="lead">Creationists <i>must</i> live on a different planet. I just <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/understanding_darwin_the_legac.php">summarized this symposium I attended</a> (it was a conference on the history and philosophy of evolutionary theory); I posted the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/philadelphia.php">schedule</a> last week, which included well-known figures in this field like Janet Browne, Jane Maienschein, Rasmus Winther, and John Beatty. In between, Michael Egnor takes this scrap of information and spins out a weird tale. He actually put up a post titled, <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/11/is_pz_myers_attending_a_confer.html">"Is P.Z. Myers Attending a Conference on Eugenics?"</a>. To which one can only mutter, "WTF?"</p>

<p>Here's his "reasoning":</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>I'm having trouble finding the program Myers is referring to (why wasn't I invited!?), but Claudia Cohen Hall is on the medical campus at Penn, so I surmise that the presentations will be on eugenics (apologies for it, I hope), which is Darwin's only legacy to medicine.</p><p>But of course eugenics won't be mentioned, except perhaps brief exculpations ("Eugenics was the misuse of Darwin's theory by a few rogue geneticists&hellip;"). No doubt the talks will be 'Children Hate Vegetables Because of Ancestral Reproductive Advantage of Avoiding Toxins' or 'We Will Evolve Oiler Skin Because of Frequent Bathing' or 'X-Linked Color Blindness Evolved to Help Paleolithic Male Hunters See Camouflage.' Believe it or not, these are actual cutting-edge evolutionary "theories."</p></blockquote>

<p>Do we need any further demonstration that creationists are divorced from reality, have no interest in pursuing the truth, and will make stuff up on the airiest of whims? No, it wasn't a conference about eugenics, pro or con. No, it wasn't about medicine. No, none of those very silly talks were given. No, since evolution contributes substantially to basic biology, all that stuff about how cells work and interact and change, evolution has contributed significantly to modern medicine &mdash; Egnor's ignorance of the mechanistic underpinnings of what medicine does is no excuse.</p>

<p>Oh, and Dr Egnor, I can guess why you weren't invited. It's because you're a babbling chowderhead.</p>
