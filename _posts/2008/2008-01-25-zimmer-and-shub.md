Zimmer interviews Shubin on [Bloggingheads](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8008) discussing how Tiktaalik was correctly predicted and eventually found by the researchers. The video which lasts over 50 minutes discusses many aspects of the find and also touches on Dover. Remember that Dover involved a creationist book called Of Pandas And People which implied that fossils like Tiktaalik had never been found and likely would never have been found.

Another gap closed.

Enjoy the video.
