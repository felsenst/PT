The Orlando Sentinel has an article by Roger describing the [pre-screening of Ben Stein's movie 'Expelled'](http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2008/02/is-ben-stein-th.html)

>  How do you re-package that tried, untested and untestable faith-without-facts warhorse, "Creationism" after its nearly-annual beat-down by an increasingly exasperated scientific community?
> 
> After you've tried renaming it "Intelligent Design," I mean.
> 
> With comedy. Mock your "Darwinist" foes the way comics, thinkers, scientists and educated people everywhere have been mocking creationism since Scopes took that monkey off our back.

Roger Moore describes the stealth campaign

> In other words, a stealth campaign, out of the public eye, preaching to the choir to get the word out about the movie without anyone who isn't a true believer passing a discouraging judgment on it.

His verdict?

> It just isn't particularly funny. Or the least bit convincing.
