[It's about evolution](http://www.sciam.com/sciammag/).\*

The title  of the full issue is "The Evolution of Evolution."  I haven't read very much yet, but some of the articles that caught my eye are

> "Testing Natural Selection with Genetics," by H. Allen Orr, an appraisal of natural selection as a major cause of evolution.
> 
> "The Latest Face of Evolution in the Classroom," by Glenn Branch and Eugenie C. Scott, a description of how creationist strategies have evolved as the environment changed.
> 
> "The Evolution of Hiccups and Hernias," by Neil Shubin, a depressing look at what kludges we are.
> 
> "Evolution of the Mind: 4 Fallacies of Psychology," by David J. Buller, a skeptical examination of "pop" evolutionary psychology.
> 
> "Putting Evolution to Work in the Everyday World," by David P. Mindell, a description of how evolutionary principles are used in, for example, medicine and disease control.

And more.

\*I was going to leave it at that (and apologize to Woody Allen).
