From the 'Expelled' website we learn about the following 'spoiler' which is written in 'white characters on a white background'.

**\*SPOILER!! Proceed and highlight text below only if you want to know more about the filmâ€™s specific content.**

> Many scenes are centered around the Berlin Wall, and Ben Stein being Jewish actually visits many death camps and death showers. In fact, Nazi Germany is the thread that ties everything in the movie together. Evolution leads to atheism leads to eugenics leads to Holocaust and Nazi Germany.

Says it all really... A refreshening honesty about the ignorance involved.
