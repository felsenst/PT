Our friends at Florida Citizens for Science have launched an [online petition](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/flascience/) to keep the pressure on the state Board of Education to adopt the new proposed science standards as they are and not water them down with creationist nonsense. We urge you all to sign it, especially if you are from Florida.
