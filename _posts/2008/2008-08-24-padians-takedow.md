Commenting on the testimony of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses in the [Kitzmiller trial](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html), someone said (paraphrased) "It was the biology course you never took but wish you had."  Reading the raw transcripts of the testimony one can easily believe that.

But it gets better.  I just discovered that Nick Matzke took [Kevin Padian's testimony and integrated Padian's slides](http://www.sciohost.org/ncse/kvd/Padian/Padian_transcript.html), so one can see what Padian was talking about as he described the paleontological evidence for evolution and the misrepresentations in _Of Pandas and People_.   I don't recall it having been flagged here before.

That had to have been a heckuva job for Nick, but it was sure worth it.  Reading it with the slides right there, the flow of the testimony is beautiful.  The integrated presentation is a significant resource for teachers and others in this arena.  I commend it to folks' attention.
