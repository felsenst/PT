[Alonzo Fyfe](http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2008/04/expelled-and-truth-tickets.html) at "Atheist Ethicist" challenges his readers to buy a Truth Ticket to offset anyone contributing to the dumbing down of America by buying an "Expelled" ticket.

Send the equivalent value of a ticket (say $10) to the NCSE using the [NCSE Donation Page](http://www.ncseweb.org/membership.asp)

James Lippard is [blogging](http://lippard.blogspot.com/2008/04/truth-tickets-to-expelled.html) this interesting development.

What irony that "Expelled" helps funding the NCSE which is doing great work exposing "Expelled" as being 'flunked'.
