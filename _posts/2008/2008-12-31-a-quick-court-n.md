A little something to start the New Year off.  Via [TaxProf](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2008/12/11th-circuit-affirms-tax-.html) we learn that Kent and Jo Hovind's appeal of their convictions on a range of charges associated with their handling of his ministry's money and tax evasion has been denied by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  On a fast scan of [the ruling](http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/200710090.pdf) (pdf), it appears that the appeal failed on all the grounds it alleged.
