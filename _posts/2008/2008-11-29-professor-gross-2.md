University Professor (emeritus) Paul Gross, who has co-authored with Barbara Forrest (of the Dover trial fame) the well-known book (2004) about the ID "movement," has now reviewed the recent book by the notorious anti-evolutionist David Berlinski. This review will soon appear in the _Free Inquiry_ magazine, but it can already be read in full in [this post](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/windmill.cfm).
