We're experimenting with a new Bathroom Wall that is hosted directly on PT instead on our forums.  (Like the old days.)

This BW also serves to torture test the new comment paneling layout that I wrote using jQuery and Ajax.  Eventually, comment preview and submission will also use Ajax.

Yes, I know the green color doesn't look right, but that's the jQuery UI default, and I haven't had time to adapt it to our site.
