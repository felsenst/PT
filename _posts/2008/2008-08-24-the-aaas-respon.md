This [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58UDTq3kaZM) from the "American Association for the Advancement of Science, " (AAAS), a non-profit science society, explains why religion and science need not be in opposition. It is a response to the intelligent design propaganda movie, "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed," with Ben Stein. AAAS also released a written statement. See [AAAS Statement Decries "Profound Dishonesty" of Intelligent Design Movie](http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2008/0418expelled.shtml) For more on how AAAS works to promote constructive dialogue between religious and scientific leaders, see [this link](http://www.aaas.org/evolution)

A powerful video addressing how science and faith can work together without damage to either.
