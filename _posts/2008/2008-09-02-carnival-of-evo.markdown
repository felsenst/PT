Good news! Thanks to the pioneering efforts of Daniel Brown, there is now a <a href="http://carnivalofevolution.blogspot.com/">Carnival of Evolution.</a> Better news! I will be hosting the next installment over at <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog">EvolutionBlog</a>. So send your best evolution related writing to me at rosenhjd@jmu.edu. I'm looking for good, original writing on anything related to evolution, so make sure you proofread your stuff before sending it to me. It's always nice to give a little link love to undeservedly obscure bloggers, so here's your chance to get some publicity. The deadline will be September 14.
