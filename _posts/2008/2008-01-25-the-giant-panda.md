<p>By way of [GrrlScientist](http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2008/01/fieldiana_zoology_now_availabl.php), I notice that _Fieldiana_ (the journal of the Field Museum is now [freely available](http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=Fieldiana%20Zoology) online. For us here at the Panda's Thumb, it means that DD Davis' [classic study](http://www.archive.org/details/giantpandamorpho03davi) "The giant panda: a morphological study of evolutionary mechanisms" of 1964 can now be enjoyed by one and all. Over three hundred pages, detailing everything you'd want to know about giant panda morphology. Steve Steve urges you all to check it out!</p>
