The discovery part of any lawsuit is a powerful tool to establish the facts

> Lawsuits come with the subpeona power of the courts for discovery. Depositions of witnesses are taken under oath. Cross-examination of witnesses is not restricted to a delimited field of questions; anything that could bear upon the credibility or trustworthiness of witnesses in court is fair game for inquiry. The court can compel answering awkward questions with contempt citations if needed.

And of course, when things get to court, exposing how every single 'persecution' story is either overblown, misleading or plain out false

> If this goes to court, what witnesses can Premise Media put on the stand who \*wouldn’t\* potentially be tainted by the revelation that every single “persecution” story in it is overblown, misleading, or simply false in its particulars?

Premise Media, may be in the enviable position of having exposed the Achilles heel of the Intelligent Design Creationism movement

> Premise Media could accomplish what outsiders never have hoped to do: bring about the complete public discrediting of the IDC movement in its most basic claims to personal integrity and suffering in the face of persecution. And it would be a completely self-inflicted wound. All Premise Media needs to do is blow off the XVIVO letter and continue with their opening schedule unaltered.

An interesting posting.
