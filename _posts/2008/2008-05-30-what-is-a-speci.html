If somebody asked me to write a short essay giving an overview of my favourite topic, the nature of species, I doubt that I could. I can write a <em>long</em> essay on it (in fact, several) but it would be excruciatingly hard to write a short one. For that, we need a real writer. Carl Zimmer is the guy. He has an <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-a-species">essay</a> on species in the current edition of <em>Scientific American</em>. And despite quoting some obscure Australian philosopher, it is a good summary of the issues. How he manages to get up on a topic like that amazes me. It took me a good five years.
