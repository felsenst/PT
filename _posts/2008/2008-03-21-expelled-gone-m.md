Expelled has gone missing in [Santa Clara](http://calladus.blogspot.com/2008/03/expelled-has-gone-truant-in-santa-clara.html)

> After all the religious spin put onto the ejection of PZ Myers while allowing Richard Dawkins into last night's showing of "Expelled", I decided that I wanted to see for myself just how easy it was to get an invite to the movie.
> 
> There seems to be some controversy about tickets - with one side saying that Dr. Myers didn't have a ticket and was acting the bully, and the other side saying that tickets weren't required, that a simple sign up was all that was required.
> 
> So I went over to the Expelled RSVP site, and signed up. BAM! I got an instant return email saying that I was golden, with a seat reserved for me. I could now attend the Santa Clara event next week Friday merely by checking my ID against a list at the door.

Simple as that, just sign up, just as PZ explained

> I told my friends about this, and started thinking... there's really no way to tell that I'm not just some average guy, and not the co-founder of an Atheist / Skeptic organization. I put "none" both in the organization and the title blocks of the registration.
> 
> My friend Richard, co-founder of CVAAS, went that extra mile and registered under our organization's name.
> 
> But it was all for naught, I'm afraid. I've just received an email notifying me that the Santa Clara showing of "Expelled" has been canceled "due to technical issues". A quick peek at the Expelled RSVP site shows that Santa Clara has been removed from the list of screenings.
> 
> Ah well, I really didn't want to drive to the San Jose area, three hours away through bad traffic to see a movie which has been described by those I trust as 'deceitful' at best, and 'boring' at worst. Now I have an excuse to not go. I guess I'll wait for it to come out on DVD, then dig it out of the Wal-mart bargain bin. It should be there right next to "Battlefield Earth".
