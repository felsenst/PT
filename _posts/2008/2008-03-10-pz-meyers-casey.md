Imagine that, Discovery Institute spokesperson Casey Luskin was caught [quote mining](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/why_do_newspapers_continue_to.php) by an observant reader of Pharyngula.

Luskin wrote

> In January, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences weighed in on this debate, declaring that "**\[t\]here is no scientific controversy about the basic facts of evolution,**"1 because neo-Darwinism is "**so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter"**2 it. As an undergraduate and graduate student taking multiple courses covering evolutionary biology at the University of California San Diego, that is what I was told as well. My science courses rarely, if ever, allowed students to seriously entertain the possibility that Darwin's theory might be fundamentally flawed.

Now the context

The first part of the quote is from page 52, near the end of the book. Here it is in context:

> \[1\] There is no scientific controversy about the basic facts of evolution. In this sense the intelligent design movement's call to "teach the controversy" is unwarranted. Of course, there remain many interesting questions about evolution, such as the evolutionary origin of sex or different mechanisms of speciation, and discussion of these questions is fully warranted in science classes.

Where do you think we'll find the second half of his quote? Page 53, maybe? Page 54? No. You'll have to thumb backwards through the book, to a place near the beginning: page 16

Sigh...
