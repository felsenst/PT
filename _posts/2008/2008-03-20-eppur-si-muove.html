<p class="lead">The Harvard multimedia team that put together that pretty video of the Inner Life of the Cell has a whole <a href="http://multimedia.mcb.harvard.edu/media.html">collection of videos online</a> (including Inner Life with a good narration.) Go watch the one titled F<sub>1</sub>-F<sub>0</sub> ATPase; it's a beautiful example of a highly efficient molecular motor, and it's the kind of thing the creationists go ga-ga over. It's complex, and it does the same rotary motion that the bacterial flagellum does; it has a little turbine in the membrane, a stream of protons drives rotation of an axle, and the movement of that axle drives conformation changes in the surrounding protein that promote the synthesis of ATP. It's a molecular machine all right. Makes a fellow wonder if possibly it's "irreducible", doesn't it?</p>

<p>Well, it's not. It can be broken down further and it still retain that rotary motion.</p>
