At the Loom, Carl Zimmer exposes yet [another hilarious example](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/30/oh-no-ive-seen-the-impossible-my-eyes/) of vacuity behind the statements of Casey Luskin.

What a way to end a great 2008

Casey Luskin wrote:

> "Bicycles have two wheels. Unicycles, having only one wheel, are missing an obvious component found on bicycles. Does this imply that you can remove one wheel from a bicycle and it will still function? Of course not. Try removing a wheel from a bike and you'll quickly see that it requires two wheels to function. The fact that a unicycle lacks certain components of a bicycle does not mean that the bicycle is therefore not irreducibly complex."

It took Zimmer a few seconds of searching on Google to find why we should not take Luskin's 'arguments' too seriously (and why Intelligent Design is doomed to remain scientifically vacuous).

Enjoy reading [yet another reason](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/30/oh-no-ive-seen-the-impossible-my-eyes/) why we should all pray for continued employment of Casey Luskin
