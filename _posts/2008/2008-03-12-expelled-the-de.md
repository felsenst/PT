More from[ Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/expelled_gets_more_bad_press.php) which I had missed

> We also have expectations of honesty that are not being met. The makers of this film had to hide their motivations every step of the way, because they know that they can't stand the harsh light of criticism. And they just can't stop lying.

> >     Logan Craft, executive producer of "Expelled" and chief of Premise Media, said he thought Mr. Moore had been wrong to attend the screening after being disinvited, but both he and Mr. Lauer denied any involvement in an online "media alert" that purported to be from a backer of the film. The alert accused Mr. Moore of posing as a minister to gain admission, calling his actions a "security breach." Mr. Moore said he never represented himself as other than a reporter.

> Oh, come on. I've got a copy of the "media alert," and it's from promotional material put out by Motive Marketing. Look at the official movie site, and right there on the bottom right is the logo for Motive Marketing. They've been bragging about using Motive for marketing, since this is also the firm that promoted Gibson's snuff movie, The Passion of the Christ. This Lauer fellow is the founder of Motive. A reader has sent me more promotional mail from these guys, and they are peddling the movie hard. And now they're lying to the New York Times and claiming they've got nothing to do with it? It seems to be a kind of pathological reflex to deny, deny, deny even when they're caught red-handed in something relatively inocuous.

Wow... I'd love to see that copy of the "media alert". And guess what, [here it is](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/02/media_alert.php)

> In response to Moore's charge that the film's manipulation of Holocaust imagery is "despicable", Stein states that "The only thing I find despicable is when reporters sneak into screenings by pretending to be ministers. This is a new low even for liberal reporters.
