Good 'ol Creationists.  Whether they are [farting](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/dembski-the-dav.html), or [rapping,](http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/2008/04/where-is-world-is-mike-edmondson.html) or challenging respected scientists [to a dual](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/06/hubris_gall_arroganceinanity.php), you can always count on Creationist antics for a good laugh.

I get an especially fine kick out of ID Creationisms attempts at courting youngsters.  'Wacky, zany' [Overwhelming Evidence](http://www.overwhelmingevidence.com/) is just another link farm for Denyse O'Leary, and William 'Im a REBEL!' Dembskis [companion book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Intellectually-Fulfilled-Atheist-Not/dp/1933859849/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1214083765&amp;amp;sr=8-1) to EXPELLED is just a chunky [regurgitation](http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/2007/09/dembski-vs-erv.html) of his _[disastrous](http://endogenousretrovirus.blogspot.com/2007/09/dembski-affair-part-2-students-have.html)_ presentation at the University of Oklahoma last fall.

But as funny as their clumsy attempts are, parents still [have trouble](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/06/teaching-intell.html) making sure their kids are getting the best science education possible.  PT regularly gets emails from concerned parents/aunts/uncles/grandparents who are looking for quality science books for their little ones.  I wont be an aunt for another few weeks (twin nieces, WHOO!!), but I jumped up with my favorite suggestions the last time Reed asked for book recommendations.  See, I was raised by a librarian and a science/math teacher (how I grew up to be such a nerd, we may never know), and one day my mom brought home the _coolest science books ever:_[Dorling Kindersley's 'Eyewitness' books](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?CAT=703147&amp;amp;SID=155835&amp;amp;SZE=10).

They have a book on [Evolution](http://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-Evolution-Books-DK-Publishing/dp/0789467194/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1214104674&amp;amp;sr=1-1).  They have a book on the [origin of life](http://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-Life-David-Burnie/dp/078944884X/ref=pd_sim_b_3) (which includes discussion of viruses!).  They have a book on [prehistoric man](http://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-Prehistoric-Life-William-Lindsay/dp/0789458683/ref=pd_sim_b_4).  They have a book on '[great scientists](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Scientists-DK-Eyewitness-Books/dp/0756629748/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1214104834&amp;amp;sr=1-1)' (which includes Darwin) as well as one _on_ [Darwin](http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Darwin-Biography-David-King/dp/0756625556/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1214104349&amp;amp;sr=1-13).

They have a book for basically any pro-science topic you can think of, and they are written in an unapologetically pro-science manner... [So Creationists hate them](http://www.helenair.com/articles/2004/03/27/helena/a09032704_01.txt).

Here is the best part (for me)---Even though most of them are targeted to 7-12 year olds, I _still_ thought they rocked when I got a chance to read them in high school.  Beautiful pictures, cram-packed with data and fun facts, they were like a 'smart' magazine.  The Eyewitness books provide ample opportunities for children _and_ parents to learn something new.  Despite their age target, these arent baby books.

And here is a bonus for you pro-science parents out there---if my hometown second grade library stocks these books, there is a good chance you can find (or request them) at _your_ local library!

But the Eyewitness books are by no means the only pro-science kids books out there!  Here are a couple others that PT writers suggested:



* [Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages](http://www.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Complete-Up-Date-Encyclopedia/dp/0375824197/)
* [Darwin and Evolution for Kids: His Life and Ideas with 21 Activities](http://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Evolution-Kids-Ideas-Activities/dp/1556525028/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1214103674&amp;amp;sr=8-1)

And Im sure many parents would be happy to have mare reader suggestions in the comments!
