In the creationist literature of various kinds an assertion is often made that Einstein was a believer in God, and this assertion is often suggested as allegedly an argument favoring religious faith. However such statements are contrary to what can be found in various documents, for example in Einstein's letters to various people.  The fate of one more such letter is revealed by Associated Press in the following message:

**Einstein letter dismissing 'childish' religion sells for 200,000 pounds**.

_By The Associated Press_  

The letter was written to philosopher Eric Gutkind in January 1954, a year before Einstein's death. In it, the Einstein said that 


> "the word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish."

Einstein also said he saw nothing "chosen" about the Jews, and that they were no better than other peoples "although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power."

Unfortunately for creationists, using the authority of Einstein as a supposed argument in favor of their beliefs is based on a distortion of the views of the great scientist. Of course, _argument from authority_ is anyway of little value.
