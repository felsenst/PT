Ke<strike>n</strike>v Miller  is the screenwriter of the ID propaganda film <a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/">Expelled</a>.  He's been  carrying on about how <a href="http://kevinwrites.typepad.com/otherwise_known_as_kevin_/2008/04/consensus-scien.html">consensus in science is repression</a>. Apart from the irony of quoting science fiction author and global warming denier <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/michael-crichtons-state-of-confusion/">Michael Crichton</a>  as an expert on the role of consensus in science, there is a complete lack of understanding of the history of science. Miller makes this jaw <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=5152;st=990#entry102758">dropping statement</a>.

<blockquote>By your logic, it was right for Galileo to be persecuted for his views, because the overwhelming majority of astronomers were certain that geocentrism was right and heliocentrism was wrong. The evidence was just so overwhelmingly obvious.  The same goes for virtually any other scientist that revolutionized his discipline. </span>

Can't these people get their history right?

Read how ID supporters can't even get basic science history right at <a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2008/04/so-much-irony-so-little-time.html">Astroblog</a>.
