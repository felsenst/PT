I've upgraded the software and plugins on this site.  Some files have changed and you may need to clear your cache to get the new files.  **If you have problems commenting, clear your browser cache.**

The most noticeable new feature is client-side validation of comment format.  If your comment is not properly formed, changes will be made to it and you will be notified of the differences before you submit.  It's not perfect or smart, but it gets the job done.  I will implement "give me original comment" and "don't validate" options if it becomes a burden to anyone.
