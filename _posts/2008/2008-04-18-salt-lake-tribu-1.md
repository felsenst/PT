> Alas, the movie's makers (Stein and co-writers Kevin Miller and Walt Ruloff, and director Nathan Frankowski) don't debate honestly. Stein mocks university officials for not "getting off \[their\] script," but says nothing about the repetitive talking points from the ID crowd. The ID folks complain that the term "evolution" is too vaguely defined, and yet never adequately define what "intelligent design" is. They swear they aren't espousing religion, then try to discredit the leading evolutionary biologists - such as Richard Dawkins and P.Z. Myers - because they are atheists.
> Oddly enough, the tactics employed in "Expelled" undercut the movie's argument, most notably in the interviews with Dawkins and Myers and in Stein's trip to Darwin's British home (now a museum). Either the filmmakers suckered these participants under false pretenses, or the evolutionists are more open to debate than Stein suggests. Perhaps the intelligent-design proponents know that in a truly open debate, their argument isn't fit enough to survive.
