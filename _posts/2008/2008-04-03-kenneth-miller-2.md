On **April 4, 2008 at 7:00 pm CDT (GMT - April 5, 2008 at 12:00 midnight), Dr. Kenneth R. Miller**, a professor of biology at Brown University, will give a talk entitled **God, Darwin, and Design: Lessons from the Dover Monkey Trial**. Miller was a lead witness in the Dover, Pennsylvania "intelligent design" case that began in September 2005, and which has been front-page news since it started.  The talk is sponsored by the The University of Texas at Austin, which is also web-casting the event, live.

The public is invited to participate in the Live Webcast of the lecture, April 4, 2008 at 7:00 pm CT ([**click here for times all over the world**](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=4&amp;day=4&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=19&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=24)). The webcasts are very high quality, and viewers can submit questions to the speaker through our website, and hear the speaker answer several online questions in real time. The webcasting software we use requires viewers to download a small plugin, but it is very simple and quick to install.

A link to the details of the lecture and the webcast could be found at:

It is recommended that participants log in to the [University of Texas at Austin link](http://www.esi.utexas.edu/outreach/ols/lectures/Miller) several minutes **before** 7 PM CDT, to have time to download the required plug-in before the Webcast begins.

What is the lecture about?

It has been 80 years since the Scopes Monkey Trial, but the debate between science and religion has never been as heated as it is now. Recent efforts to introduce "intelligent design" into science classes will likely lead to a major Supreme Court ruling on the issue. Kenneth R. Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University, is a preeminent evolutionary scientistâ€”and the author of the most widely used high school biology textbook in America. He is perfectly suited to address this controversial topic on many fronts.

The Webcast will also be **archived**, so click [**here**](http://www.esi.utexas.edu/outreach/ols/lectures/Miller) to view it after the 4th.

Dr. Miller was a guest on the Feb. 2nd, 2008 edition of [**NMSR's Science Watch Radio**](http://web.mac.com/nmsrorg/iWeb/scienceWatch/Home.html); the podcast of the hour-long show is available [**here**](http://web.mac.com/nmsrorg/iWeb/scienceWatch/Best%20of%20Science%20Watch/Best%20of%20Science%20Watch.html).
