<img src="http://scit.us/openlab/openlab07-200.png" alt="Openlab 2007" width="200" height="125" style="float:right;" />  Well Bora and I and our 30+ judges managed to sort through the nearly 500 submissions and find our [53 winners](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/open_lab_2007_the_winning_entr.php).  Some of use used the stairs methods to assign grades and others programed complex random number machines, while a few decided to read the 400+ submissions.

I am happy to announce that Ian Musgrave will represent the Panda's Thumb again this year in The Open Laboratory with an essay that fuses two excellent articles:

[Stuck on you, biological Velcro and the evolution of adaptive immunity](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/stuck-on-you-bi.html)

[Behe vs Sea Squirts](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/02/behe-vs-sea-squ.html)

Let's congratulate Ian for his contributions to science blogging.
