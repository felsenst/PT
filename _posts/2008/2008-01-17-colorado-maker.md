The Colorado Daily [reports](http://www.coloradodaily.com/articles/2008/01/17/news/c_u_and_boulder/news1.txt) that Michael Korn, the person who emailed death threats to biology faculty at Colorado University - Boulder was sent a restraining order in email on December 6th, and agreed to its terms in minutes. They apparently used email because no one seems to know just where Michael Korn might reside.

The article relies in part upon material quoted here on Panda's Thumb.
