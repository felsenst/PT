At 4:00 Eastern time today (Jan 18), Michael Behe will be on [Christian radio KKMS](http://www.kkms.com) in Minneapolis.  It'll be streamed live -- I haven't yet figured out whether it will be archived.  It's advertised as

I'll be interested to see just how (or whether) they integrate Behe's self-professed acceptance of an old earth and common descent into their young earth worldview, and how they treat his view that malaria was intentionally designed.
