Another creation myth bites the dust \[1\]. As reported on the BBC site [ Ancient serpent shows its leg](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7339508.stm), scientists have uncovered a fossil of a snake with two legs.

> Scientists have only a handful of specimens that illustrate the evolutionary narrative that goes from ancient lizard to limbless modern serpent.

In other words, this fossil helps fill in a major gap in the fossil data. The snake fossil is called _Eupodophis descouensi_.
