ID folks make numerous assertions said to represent scientific challenges to conventional evolutionary theory.  These claims are uniformly wrong, which is one of the reasons scientists generally ignore them.

But ID folks also claim that adopting a design perspective could lead to great progress in science, if only scientists would take off their materialist blinders.  There is an acid test for all such claims:  Go discover something!  Writers are fond of saying &ldquo;Show, don't tell,&rdquo; and that adage applies very well here.  If your perspective is so useful, then prove it by discovering something the conventional methods had overlooked.

Denyse O'Leary <a href="http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/2008/01/nine-predictions-if-intelligent-design.html">has posted</a> her very own list of nine &ldquo;predictions&rdquo; that follow from ID.  Why do I put the word &ldquo;predictions&rdquo; in sneer quotes?  Because with this post O'Leary has achieved a level of cluelessness to which most ID proponents can only aspire.  I <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2008/01/oleary_proves_that_id_is_worth.php#more">elaborate over at EvolutionBlog.</a>  Comments may be left there.
