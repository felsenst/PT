[Darwin Day](http://www.darwinday.org/) is fast approaching, and we'll be celebrating with 2 and a half days' worth of festivities here in Iowa next month, on February 14-16.  We're featuring talks by [Dr. Massimo Pigliucci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Pigliucci), [Dr. Martha McClintock](http://imb.uchicago.edu/faculty/mcclintock.html), and University of Iowa paleontologist [Dr. Christopher Brochu](http://www.uiowa.edu/~geology/people/faculty/brochu/index.html), as well as a dinner social Friday night (tickets required, and they're already going fast!).  Head over to [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2008/01/darwin_day_2008_in_iowa_city.php) for all the details.
