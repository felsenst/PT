Another video by [DonExodus2](http://www.youtube.com/user/DonExodus2) below the fold discussing the infamous list of 'scientists' rejecting evolution.

PS: DonExodus mentions that You DeWitt received his undergraduate degree from Case Western Reserve University it was his PhD degree. Minor detail.

From the [Biography page at AIG](http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/d_dewitt.asp):  Dr David A. DeWitt received a B.S. in biochemistry from Michigan State University  and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Case Western Reserve University. Also the lastest [List of 'doubters'](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=660) includes the correct affiliation for DeWitt as Liberty University. The list analyzed by DonExodus is [the original list of 'doubters'](http://www.discoveringdesign.org/framelink.php?mylink=/articles/100ScientistsAd.pdf)

Clearly not very intelligently designed...
