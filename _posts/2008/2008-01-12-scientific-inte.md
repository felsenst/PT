The [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/) has released a six section [overview](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/intelligent-design.html) on Science, Evolution, and Intelligent Design

Section 1: [Science as a Way of Knowing](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/science-way-of-knowing.html)<br />
Section 2: [Science and Society](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/science-and-society.html)<br />
Section 3: [Evolution, Creationism, and Intelligent Design](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/evolution-creationism-and-id.html)<br />
Section 4: [Why Intelligent Design is not Science](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/why-id-is-not-science.html)<br />
Section 5: [Science Education and Intelligent Design](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/science-education-and-id.html)<br />
Section 6: [Fairness and Balance in the Classroom and Beyond](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/fairness-and-balance.html)<br />

I would add another section on the scientific vacuity or infertility of Intelligent Design. Ask yourself this simple question: What non-trivial contribution has Intelligent Design made to our scientific understanding? And ask you then a follow-up question: For those systems which ID claims to be designed, how does ID explain these systems?

The answers, or lack thereof, may surprise you.
