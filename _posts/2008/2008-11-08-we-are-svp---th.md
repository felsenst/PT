The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology has come up with a very well-produced video introduction to the Society.  

The Society's [**website**](http://www.vertpaleo.org/video/WeAreSVP/index.cfm) says


> WE ARE SVP is a 33-minute video that tells the inside story of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology -- who we are, what we do, and why our work is important for science and society.  The video is introduced and narrated by Sam Waterston, the long-time star of "LAW & ORDER."

While the whole video is worthwhile, some of you may want to go straight to Chapter 4, "Evolution Vs. Creationism."  It's got Kevin Padian and more., Go ahead - [**you know you want to**](http://www.vertpaleo.org/video/WeAreSVP/index.cfm).

Cheers, Dave
