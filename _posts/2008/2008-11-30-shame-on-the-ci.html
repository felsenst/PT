<p class="lead">The <a href="https://tickets.cincinnatizoo.org/mainstore.asp?vid=0">Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden</a> and the <a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/museum/2008/11/30/creation-museumcincinnati-zoo-combo-tickets-now-available/">Creation Museum</a> have made a joint marketing agreement and are selling "combo tickets" to get into both attractions for one price.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Zoo is <i>promoting</i> an anti-science, anti-education con job run by ignorant creationists.</p>

<p>Unbelievable.</p>

<p>Here's a little bit <a href="http://www.cincinnatizoo.org/about/history.html">about</a> the Cincinnati Zoo. I've highlighted a few key words and phrases.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Part of the public school system</b> in Cincinnati since 1975, the Zoo <b>hosts a four-year college prepatory program</b> - Zoo Academy. The Cincinnati Zoo is proud to serve as </b>the leading non-formal science educator</b> in Southwest Ohio. <b>Over 300,000 students</b> participate in the Zoo's educational programs annually.
</p><p>
The Zoo has long been successful at captive breeding, starting with trumpeter swans and sea lions back in the 1880s.  The Lindner Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) was founded in 1986 to strengthen the tradition. The <b>research conducted here has made the Cincinnati Zoo an international leader</b> in the protection and propagation of endangered animals and plants around the world. 
</p><p>
Rated by peer zoological parks as <b>one of the best zoos in the nation</b>, the Cincinnati Zoo continues to set the standard for conservation, <b>education</b> and preservation of wild animals and wild spaces. Over 1.2 million people visit the Zoo annually. The Zoo features more than 500 animal and 3,000 plant species, making it one of the largest Zoo collections in the country.</p></blockquote>

<p>I believe the Cincinnati Zoo has betrayed its mission and its trust in a disgraceful way, by aligning themselves with a creationist institution that is a laughing stock to the rest of the world, and a mark of shame to the United States. I urge everyone to <a href="http://www.cincinnatizoo.org/contact/default.html">contact the zoo</a>; write to their <a href="mailto:registrars@cincinnatizoo.org">education</a> and <a href="mailto:pr@cincinnatizoo.org">marketing and public relations</a> departments in particular and point out the conflict between what they are doing and what their goal as an educational and research institution ought to be. </p>

<p>While you're at it, it might be even more effective to contact the <a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=CONTACT">newsroom at the Cincinnati Enquirer</a> and the <a href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/flex-105-contact.html">Cincinnati weekly, City Beat</a>. Let's raise a stink and give these guys the bad PR they deserve.</p>

<hr /><p>Good news! Upon discovering this embarrassing news this morning, the Cincinnati Zoo has moved with commendable swiftness to remove the combo tickets offer from their website. The Creation Museum, however, has not done so just yet.</p>
