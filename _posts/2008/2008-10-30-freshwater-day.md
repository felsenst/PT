Day 5 of the Freshwater hearing was today, but my post on it won't be up until tomorrow night at the earliest.  Tonight my seminar on the history of the controversies surrounding the theory of evolution is going to a Chautauqua performance about Clarence Darrow, and then I'm going to bed.

As a consolation prize read Glenn Branch's [Zombie Jamboree in Texas](http://www.beaconbroadside.com/broadside/2008/10/zombie-jamboree.html) in the Beacon Broadside.  Texas is heading for a potential disaster in science education.
