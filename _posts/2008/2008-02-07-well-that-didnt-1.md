The Board of Regents met to hear Gonzalez's appeal this morning.  It's worth noting that they rarely take a differing view on tenure decisions from the tenure committee itself.  So sorry [Tara](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2008/02/guillermo_gonzalez_tenure_revi.php), you got it wrong... the decision is [already out](http://media.www.iowastatedaily.com/media/storage/paper818/news/2008/02/07/News/Gonzales.Denied.Tenure.Appeal-3195263.shtml), and it's not a shocker:

> The Iowa Board of Regents has denied Guillermo Gonzales', associate professor of physics and astronomy, appeal for tenure. After a private deliberation, the Board voted down the appeal which has already been denied by Iowa State University and ISU President Gregory Geoffroy.

No details at this point.  But look for the Discovery Institute Spin Room to start kvetching at any moment, if they haven't already.  At least Casey Luskin will have something to whine about besides his [inability to figure out internet image copyright stuff](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/02/cause_effect_and_crying_poor_m.php).  Might I suggest that he just pretend that Gonzalez was actually thrice denied tenure-- once by the tenure board, once by the Preznident, and once by the Board of Regents-- for maximum martyrhood?  

It's practically Biblical.
