For the last couple of years, [New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR)](http://www.nmsr.org) has been hosting the [**Science Watch radio show on Saturdays at 2:00 PM on AM 1350**](http://www.nmsr.org/goradio.htm), in the Albuquerque area. The hosts are PT's Dave Thomas, plus Kim Johnson, Marshall Berman, and Kim's son Jesse, regarded by New Mexico's ID community as the fearsome "_[Darwinist Swat Team](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/12/game-over-in-ri.html)_."

Before now, only people in the Albuquerque metro area could listen to the show, and then, only on Saturdays at 2.  But now, thanks to the power of the Internets, anyone in the world can listen in, at any time!  [NMSR](http://www.nmsr.org) and [CESE](http://www.cesame-nm.org/) have joined to create a radio podcast website (built by Science Watch co-host Marshall Berman's son Brandon!) for anyone, anywhere, to listen to the most recent shows, as well as the Best of Science Watch episodes. Topics range from Intelligent Design Creationism to homeopathy, UFOs, and a lot of good mainstream science as well as "fake" science.

The podcast website is: [http://web.mac.com/nmsrorg/iWeb/scienceWatch/Home.html](http://web.mac.com/nmsrorg/iWeb/scienceWatch/Home.html).

Check out The Feb. 2nd, 2008 one-hour interview  with Prof. Ken Miller of Brown, on his involvement in the Dover PA "ID Trial."  Or, listen to the November 17th, 2007 post-NOVA Dover show with Prof. Barbara Forrest, in the "Best of" section.

If you have technical problems, please e-mail Science Watch staff from [our radio updates page](http://www.nmsr.org/goradio.htm). 

Special Note for Trolls: remember, these are podcasts, and are no longer live.   If you call the number given during the Trivia Segment, be advised that no one will answer the phone.

If reading is more suitable to you, why not check out Marshall Berman's Feb. 13th Darwin Day Talk to NMSR, [**"The 'Intelligently Designed' Attack on Science and Society."**](http://www.nmsr.org/mberman.pdf)
