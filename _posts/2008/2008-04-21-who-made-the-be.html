<p class="lead">We have a confession! It was made by Michael Edmondson, and it was produced by the people behind <i>Expelled</i>. He wrote to me, and says, "The intent of the video has been questioned a lot&hellip;I suppose the answer is that I tried to make something that was funny to me and It's not really meant to convince anyone of anything." That's how I felt about it: it's amusing, and that's all that matters &mdash; it's vague enough that it can be read any way you want.</p>

<p>Edmondson has also made a brief sequel.</p>
