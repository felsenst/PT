By now regular readers of The Panda's Thumb know that "academic Freedom" bills have been [filed](http://blogs.tampabay.com/schools/2008/03/religion-has-no.html) in the Florida legislature, and you know that the bills are Disco designed. You have also [noticed](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/03/discovery_institute_dishonest.php) Disco's [complaint](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/03/darwinist_activists_at_florida.html) that people get it. The complaint reads like disingenuous gibberish, but why that specific gibberish?

Son of _Of Pandas and People_ is the answer. Recall that the ID gang at the Discovery Institute (Disco) got the Dover school board in trouble with their creationist textbook _Of Pandas and People_, in which the words "intelligent design" and "design proponents" had been substituted for the words "creationism" and "creationists", with [_“cdesign proponentsists”_](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html) as an intermediate form.

The Disco fellows then wrote a new book called _Explore Evolution_ to do the job of _Of Pandas and People_.  The job is to present so called strengths of evolution in such a pale way that no one would think life evolved, and then pour on the [usual false and misleading "weaknesses"](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html).  

This new book is precisely the book to use to teach Disco's version of strengths and weaknesses. PT [previously reported](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/07/dont-say-i-didn.html) on a [**World Magazine** article](http://www.worldmag.com/archives/2007-07-21) making the point.

> This fall, the 34-year teaching veteran  will restructure his evenhanded presentation around a new textbook from the Seattle-based Discovery Institute. Explore Evolution: The Arguments for and Against Neo-Darwinism (Hill House Publishers, 2007) does not address alternative theories of origins but succinctly lays out the scientific strengths and weaknesses of the most critical elements of Darwinism. “It’s made my work a lot easier,” Cowan said.
> 
> Explore Evolution encapsulates a “teach the controversy” paradigm that the Discovery Institute has advocated for the better part of the past decade.

PT also [reported](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/explore-evoluti.html) on an [Old Earth Homeschool blog](http://oldearthcreationism.blogspot.com/2007/08/teaching-symposium-day-1.html) which in turn reports on an event at Biola to make the same point:

> Wow, long day. I was down at Biola all day attending a symposium which unveiled a new curriculum designed to be used in public school classrooms (both at the high school and college level) to expose students to the strengths and weaknesses of neo-Darwinian evolution.
> 
> Explore Evolution: The Arguments for and Against Neo-Darwinism (Hill House Publishers, 2007)
> 
> This is intended to be a supplement to a standard biology textbook. It presents the strengths and weaknesses of the evolutionary position and allow students to decide for themselves whether neo-Darwinism is, in fact, supported by the scientific record. The book does not promote Intelligent Design in any way, shape or form. However, it is written by leaders in the Intelligent Design movement and they don't seem to be making any secret about this.

This explains why Crowther is frantically trying to convince everyone that the "academic freedom" bill means "strengths and weaknesses" and nothing but that, the actual words in the bill and what they mean to folks without his special agenda notwithstanding. 

There is extensive exploration of _Explore Evolution_ [here at AtBC](http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=4697bedc517e27a9;act=ST;f=14;t=5133). The book is not noted for good science, but it is very good creationism. The Disco plan seems to be to do Dover over using _Son of Pandas_ aka _Explore Evolution_ and the academic freedom bill.  Will it work?
