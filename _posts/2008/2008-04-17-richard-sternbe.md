Casey Luskin is currently in the middle of a multi-part "rebuttal" to Michael Shermer's review of _[Expelled](http://www.expelledexposed.com/)_. In the [latest installment](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/04/michael_shermers_factfree_atta.html) of his whine, Casey (again) brings up the case of Richard Sternberg. Sternberg, some of you might remember, orchestrated the publication of a pro-Intelligent Design paper near the end of his term as editor of Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. 
</p>

<p>
As [punishment](http://www.scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/creating_a_martyr_the_sternber.php) for this heinous crime, Sternberg suffered the indignity of not getting fired from the unpaid editorship that he had quit months before the paper actually appeared. His punishment further included the cruel and unusual steps of not dismissing him from his unpaid position as a Smithsonian Research Associate, not declining to renew the unpaid position when the term expired, and not firing him from his paid job at NIH. The draconian nature of the consequences that he ultimately suffered - some of his colleagues said bad things about him - obviously makes him the ideal example of an open-thinking scientist railroaded by the Darwinian Inquisition.

I'm not going to deal with the vast majority of Casey's attempt to obfuscate the real events that surrounded the whole Sternberg affair. He raises absolutely no new points, and all of the points that he does raise have been [rebutted](http://www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/the-truth/sternberg) before. Instead, I'm going to focus on two points in Luskin's post where he massively misrepresents things that other people wrote.
