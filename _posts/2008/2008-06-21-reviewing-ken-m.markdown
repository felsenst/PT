I have spent the last few days reading Ken Miller's new book <i>Only a Theory: Evolution and the Battle for America's Soul.</i>  Short review: Well worth reading, but also a bit disappointing in places.  Miller is at his best when he is describing the science behind evolution, and he has many illuminating things to say about the importance of the evolution/ID issue to the future of American science.  But I find his theological arguments to be a bit weak, and there are places where his arguments against the ID folks are not as sharp and forceful as they might have been.  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2008/06/my_review_of_only_a_theory.php">Click here</a> for my full review, and let me know what you think!
