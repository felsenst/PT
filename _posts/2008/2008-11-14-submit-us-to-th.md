Only  [two weeks remain](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/the_open_laboratory_2008_two_w.php), and there is a lack of nominations from the Panda's Thumb.  Your mission, readers, is to find our best articles from the last year and nominate them from the Panda's Thumb.  The rumor I'm hearing is that anti-anti-evolution blog posts are going to get the shiv this year, so try to focus on posts that are not responses to the stupidity that is ("intelligent design") creationism.

Just click the image to nominate some posts of ours.
