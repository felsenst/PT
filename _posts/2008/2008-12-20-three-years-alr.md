Can you believe it's been three years since [Judge Jones issued a devastating anti-"Intelligent Design" ruling](http://ncseweb.org/resources/kitzmiller)?

Ah, the memories of Kitzmas past.  Remember ["Waterloo in Dover"](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/12/waterloo-in-dov.html)? ["Cdesign proponentsists."](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html)?  The ["breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision"](http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf)?

Even though the Creationist Choir says that Kitzmiller v. Dover is ["No big deal"](http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2008/12/20/three-years-since-dover-merry-kitzmas/), it's obvious they're still smarting over their wounds.

Anyway, "Intelligent Design" is so yesterday.  Everyone knows [**Strengths and Weaknesses**](http://www.nmsr.org/stork.htm) is the Big New Thing.

**Merry Kitzmas, everyone!**
