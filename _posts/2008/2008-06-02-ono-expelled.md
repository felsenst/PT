The newswires report that the judge in the case [has ruled](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/expelledsdny.pdf) that the use of copyrighted materials in the movie Expelled is protected by the "Fair Use" doctrine and that the request for preliminary injunction has been lifted.

> NEW YORK â€”  Yoko Ono has lost her Manhattan legal battle to block the use of John Lennon's song "Imagine" in a film challenging the theory of evolution.
> 
> Lennon's widow had sued the makers of "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed," saying they used parts of the song without her permission.
> 
> In a decision Monday, federal Judge Sidney Stein says the filmmakers are protected under the "fair use" doctrine. That permits small parts of a copyrighted work to be used without an author's permission under certain circumstances.
