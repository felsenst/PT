It's not certain there will be a decision immediately, though:

[From the Iowa State Daily:](http://media.www.iowastatedaily.com/media/storage/paper818/news/2008/02/07/News/Gonzalez.Appeal.To.Be.Decided.By.Board.Of.Regents-3193635.shtml)

> The Iowa Board of Regents will meet Thursday to discuss the tenure denial appeal of Guillermo Gonzalez, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Iowa State, at its regional meeting on the ISU campus.
> 
> The meeting is at 8:30 a.m., with a one-hour closed session dedicated to discussing the appeal beginning at 8:35 a.m. The regents will emerge with either a decision on the case or a decision to postpone it.
> 
> "The board does not have to decide within the hour time slot given for the meeting, and discussion may take place over the following days," said Iowa Board of Regents President David Miles.

Stay tuned...
