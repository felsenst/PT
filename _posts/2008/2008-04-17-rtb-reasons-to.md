For instance, The Reasons To Believe (RTB) Scholars appeared to be [suspicious about Expelled](http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/expelled.shtml) but refrained from any recommendations but now that they have seen a pre-release screening they have sent an email which can be found on the Calvin College [ASA](http://www.calvin.edu/archive/asa/200804/0348.html) discussion list.

Earn the right to be heard. That means hard work, doing the necessary science and not rely on a scientifically vacuous concept like Intelligent Design.

This is an interesting and important point as "Expelled" seems to have been biased in who they decided to interview and who not. In fact, openly Christian scientists like Kenneth Miller and ~~Richard~~ Francis Collins were **not interviewed** because they 'confuse the story'.

Amen
