[Sneer Review](http://sneerreview.blogspot.com/2008/05/wegwood-document.html) reports on an in-depth investigation into "The Wedgwood Document" which outlines how the teapot from the famous atheist Bertrand Russell was acquired to undermine the recent successes from atheists.

Remember that Bertrand Russell had stated

> “If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion .............. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.”

This simple statement set in motion a series of events which will reverberate in history.
