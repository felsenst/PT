Yesterday, I wrote [a post](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/02/blogging_about_peerreviewed_re.php) about Casey Luskin's misuse of the ResearchBlogging.org "Blogging about Peer-Reviewed Research" icon. Today, Casey removed the icon from his post, and provided [an explanation](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/02/leslie_orgel_metabolic_origin.html#researchblogging) for his actions. I'm glad that he decided to cease his misuse of the icon, but his explanation leaves a heck of a lot to be desired. He admits no wrongdoing, makes no apology, and presents a series of excuses for his actions that - even if accepted at face value - are weak at best.
