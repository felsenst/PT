Readers from waaaay back may recall an event I helped out with a few years ago, bringing together scientists, philosophers, and our [resident IDist](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/02/skiff.php) to discuss evolution and intelligent design.  One of the speakers was University of Iowa professor [Mark Blumberg](http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/blumberg/blumberg.html), a colleague in the Department of Psychology.  Dr. Blumberg also happens to be a [prolific](http://www.amazon.com/Body-Heat-Temperature-Life-Earth/dp/0674013697/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228401527&amp;sr=1-2) [author](http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Instinct-Behavior-Mark-Blumberg/dp/1560259000/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1228401527&amp;sr=1-3), and has just released his [third book](http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Faculty/Blumberg/FreaksofNaturethebook.html) in 4 years:  "Freaks of Nature:  What Anomalies Tell us About Development and Evolution."   

As if that wasn't enough (and all of this while maintaining a very active laboratory, serving as Editor-in-Chief of _Behavioral Neuroscience_, and as President of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology--and presumably sleeping at some point), he's also now [getting his feet wet as a blogger](http://blog.oup.com/2008/11/bridgeless-gaps/), discussing the legacy of Richard Goldschmidt, and the "bridgeless gaps" between species--and between evolutionary biologists.  Stop by and welcome him to the author side of the blogosphere (he's been a reader for awhile), and look for a review of "Freaks of Nature" here at some point in the future.
