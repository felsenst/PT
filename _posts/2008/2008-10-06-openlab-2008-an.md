**By Bora Zivkovic**

First, there was the [First NC Science Blogging Conference](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/conference_blogging.php).  Then, there was the [Second NC Science Blogging Conference](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/science_blogging_conference_vi.php).  And yes, we will have the Third one - renamed **ScienceOnline'09** to better reflect the scope of the meeting: this time bigger and better than ever.

ScienceOnline'09 will be held Jan. 16-18, 2009 at the [Sigma Xi Center](http://www.sigmaxi.org/) in Research Triangle Park, NC.

Please join us for this **free** three-day event to explore science on the Web. Our goal is to bring together scientists, bloggers, educators, students, journalists, writers, publishers, Web developers and others to discuss, demonstrate and debate online strategies and tools for promoting the public understanding of science.

The conference is organized jointly by [BlogTogether](http://blogtogether.org/), the North Carolina bloggers' group, and [WiSE @ Duke](http://www.duke.edu/web/wise/), the Women in Science and Engineering organization at Duke University, with help from Sigma Xi and other sponsors.

The people behind the organization are [Anton Zuiker](http://mistersugar.com/), [Bora Zivkovic (aka Coturnix)](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/) and [Abel Pharmboy](http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/), with additional generous help by [Brian Russell](http://yesh.com/) and [Paul Jones](http://ibiblio.org/pjones/blog).

Just like last two times, we are preparing the publication of the [Science Blogging Anthology](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/09/submit_your_entries_for_the_th.php) and, this time, we'll try to really have it ready and up for sale at the conference itself.
