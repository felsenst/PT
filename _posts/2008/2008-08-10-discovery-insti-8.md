> The important thing about Intelligent Design is that it is not a theory - which is something I think they need to make more clear. Nor is Intelligent Design an explanation. Intelligent Design is a challenge. It's a challenge to evolution. It does not replace evolution with something else.

And who is this Senior Fellow? Michael Medved of course, who recently became a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute. Seems that the DI may be having some problem hiring qualified people. The problem is that in his usual ignorance Medved explains exactly what ID is and isn't.
