The New York Academy of Sciences provides us with [access to a talk](http://www.nyas.org/publications/readersReport.asp?articleID=57) by Nobel Laureate Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard on how genes drive development, no need for unspecified 'Intelligent Designers', no need for miracles, just hard work by  scientists who are committed to discovering the details of how, what, when and so on. Compare this with how ID explains the development of the embryo.

I also suggest that interested readers get their hands on her book "[Coming to Life: How Genes Drive Development](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0967007674/newyorkacadem-20)" by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard or read an excerpt of the book: [Chapter IX — Evolution, Body Plans, and Genomes ](http://www.nyas.org/pdfs/RWEx57_nusslein_volhard.pdf)
