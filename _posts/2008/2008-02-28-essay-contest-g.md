Tomorrow is the last day to get your [Alliance for Science Evolution Essay contest](http://www.allianceforscience.org/essay) submissions done!  You know you want a shot at some money for school books and some free, signed media materials.  This year looks to be even better than last, so we look forward to reading what you have to say!  Remember, the science teacher for the winning essay writer gets rewarded too, and deservedly so; our teachers work hard and deserve something back.
