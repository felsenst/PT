In the Economist, an [article](http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10903480&amp;top_story=1) explores how scientists are trying to explain religion.
In a [project](http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/research/cam/projects/explaining_religion/) titled "explaining religion" that involves scholars from 14 universities, researchers from many different disciplines are attempting to unravel the biological explanation for religion.  The project receives funding from the ["New and Emerging Science and Technology"](http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP6_PROJ&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=5&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=1206550192113&amp;RCN=85152) programme of the European Union. The same programme also organizes the [Tackling complexity in Science](ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/nest/docs/b5_tackling_web_complet.pdf) project and I noticed the absence of any ID relevant proposals.

Well, back to real science:

> The project has four principal scientific objectives:
> 
> 1. To characterize precisely the main elements of the universal religious repertoire and the extent of its variation<br />
> 2. To establish the principal causes of the universal religious repertoire<br />
> 3. To account for variations in the degree of elaboration (and emphasis) of each element of the repertoire in different religious traditions, contemporaneously and historically<br />
> 4. To develop models for simulating future courses of transformation in specified religious systems<br />
> 
> These objectives involve ethnographic, historical and psychological research carried out by selected fellows, postgraduate students, and European project partners. Publication of major findings can be found on this website.

From a Christian perspective I find it thrilling that God set in motion a process which evolved in us a sense of religion, bringing His Creation closer to Him. Were Adam and Eve the first humanoids who achieved a religious consciousness? Seems to make a lot of sense and it would resolve the unnecessary conflict between the Bible and the age of the Universe and this earth.
From a scientific perspective I find it fascinating how religion may have evolved, showing us a better understanding of our evolutionary history.
