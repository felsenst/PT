[Epsilon Clue](http://www.ooblick.com/weblog/2008/04/19/expelled-in-good-company/) puts the Rotten Tomato ratings of [Expelled](http://www.expelledexposed.com) in the context of some real clunkers.  A couple of selected entries:

> Plan 9 from Outer Space: Ed Woodâ€™s famously-bad movie starring Bela Lugosi, who died after shooting only five minutes of film: 62%. Granted, this is skewed by the camp value of the result.
> 
> ...
> 
> The Dukes of Hazzard: Car chases and short shorts. Not exactly Oscar material. 14%
> 
> ...
> 
> Left Behind: Sappy melodramatic Christian porn: 12%
> 
> and
> 
> And finally, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, the plucky new documentary that blows the lid off the anti-creationism conspiracy: 9%.

Shoot, Ben Stein can't even beat the Britney Spears epic Crossroads (not the one PZed was interviewed for) which made a stellar 15%.  Read the full post at [Epsilon Clue](http://www.ooblick.com/weblog/2008/04/19/expelled-in-good-company/).
