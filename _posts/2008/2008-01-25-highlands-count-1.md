Florida Citizens for Science have posted [another article](http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=408) showing what is the real motivations behind the opposition to the Florida science standards.

> Norris, who is also a Lutheran minister, has stated that evolution should not be taught as fact and that students should be able to discuss creationism in class.
> 
> ...
> 
> School Board Vice Chairman Andy Tuck said Thursday, "as a person of faith, I strongly oppose any study of evolution as fact at all. I'm purely in favor of it staying a theory and only a theory.

Help us educate these [school boards](http://www.highlands.k12.fl.us/board.html).  They seem to be confused that the standards call evolution a fact when it doesn't. They also seem to believe that there may be competing theories of evolution; there are none. 

And keep those postings coming, as they are documenting a clear religious component to the resolutions passed.

As their own [school board agenda](http://www.highlands.k12.fl.us/wkshp013108.pdf) states "“HONESTY” “Honesty is something which must be known with the mind, accepted with the heart and enacted in life.” "

Next regular School Board meeting is February 5, 2008 at 5:30 p.m.

> All Meetings are held in the Garland Boggus Board Room at the School Board's Administration Building located at 426 School Street, Sebring, FL 33870 ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=426+School+St,+Sebring,+FL+33870,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title)), (863)471-5555.

# St Augustine

From The Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim) 

> Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion. \[1 Timothy 1.7\]
