There are many excellent resources available online and I recently ran across a conference organized by John C. Avise and Francisco J. Ayala called [In the Light of Evolution I: Adaptation and Complex Design](http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=SACKLER_evolution_program)

In the presentation that caught my initial interest, Robert Hazen explains the various steps necessary for the origin of life and defines complexity and shows how complexity can increase. I have combined notes on his lecture with additional papers and presentations by Robert Hazen, in order to outline that which many creationists insist, does not exist: a scientific explanation of the origins of life. 

I predict that ID creationists will be quick to argue that these are just so stories, and yet, these are stories which present testable hypotheses. And thus I invited ID creationists to present the best explanation as to how ID explains these data?

Seems fair enough.
