I made reference to this in a comment, but thought I'd promote it.  The Guardian has a video up on [innovative approaches to teaching evolution](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/video/2008/nov/07/creationism-evolution-teachers) to secondary school students in Great Britain.  It also interviews Martin Reiss, the recently resigned/ousted Education Officer of the Royal Society.

Added in edit: John Pieret has [a post on a survey](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2008/11/creative-teachers.html) associated with the show.  (Though I apparently can't send a trackback there.)
