I've made some changes to our custom javascripts and some of our backend code.  I've also enabled compression of the webpages.  Hopefully, things will be more responsive.

Our biggest change was the migration from the Prototype javascript library to the jQuery library.  Most of the behavior is the same, although some bugs have been fixed.

Our most noticeable change was replacing the existing spellchecker with a new one: GoogieSpell.
