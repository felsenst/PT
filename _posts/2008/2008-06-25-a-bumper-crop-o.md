People looking for passionate defenses of theistic evolution certainly have a lot of options this summer.  Having recently [reviewed](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2008/06/my_review_of_only_a_theory.php) Ken Miller's [_Only a Theory_](http://www.amazon.com/Only-Theory-Evolution-Battle-Americas/dp/067001883X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1214437385&amp;sr=8-1), I decided next to have a go at Karl Giberson's book [_Saving Darwin: How to be a Christian and Believe in Evolution_](http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Darwin-Christian-Believe-Evolution/dp/0061228788/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1214437447&amp;sr=1-1).  Giberson is a professor of physics at Eastern Nazarene College.

Those of us who believe that the union between evolution and Christianity is at best an unhappy marriage are often lectured about having an unsophisticated view of theology.       I can only reply that I judge theistic evolution by the arguments I find in the books defending it, and those arguments are not very convincing, in my opinion.  I elaborate on this statement in [   my review](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2008/06/my_review_of_saving_darwin.php) of Giberson's book.  Comments may be left there.
