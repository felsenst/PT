John Freshwater was interviewed by Bob Burney on the April 28th, 2008 on 880 WRFD. I listened to the [interview](http://supportfreshwater.com/Freshwater%20Interview%20on%20BBL%20-%204.28.08.mp3) and was amazed by how Freshwater's friends help undermine his own case

Bob mentions that one of his son's is in Freshwater's class

Bob: And from day 1, John, he has been telling me what a wonderful teacher you are and the fact that you present both sides to issues and which is just wonderful and unfortunately kind of rare in the schools today.

So what do you guess, did Freshwater tell about the two sides of homosexuality? Or was this a topic in which John decided to tell only one side of the story? 

From CNN we [learn](http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/06/20/teacher.cross/) that

> The report also cites evidence that Mr. Freshwater told his students that "science is wrong because the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin and so anyone who is gay chooses to be gay and is therefore a sinner."

Listen to the rest for more foolishness.
