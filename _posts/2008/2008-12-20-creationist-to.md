As everyone knows by now, President-Elect Barack Obama has chosen his "friend" Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration. Mr. Warren is not just opposed to marriage between homosexuals, but is also an evolution denier. According to [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/us/politics/20warren.html), Mr. Obama defended his choice with these words:

> That's part of the magic of this country, is \[sic\] that we are diverse and noisy and opinionated \[sic\]. That's hopefully going to be a spirit that carries over into my administration.

Mr. Warren's position on marriage between homosexuals is now widely known, but according to Sarah Posner, writing in  [The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081229/posner?rel=hp_picks) magazine, Warren is also a creationist:

> Warren, a creationist, believes that homosexuality disproves evolution; he told CNN's Larry King in 2005, "If Darwin was right, which is survival of the fittest\[,\] then homosexuality would be a recessive gene because it doesn't reproduce and you would think that over thousands of years that \[sic\] homosexuality would work itself out of the gene pool."

Sic, sic, sic.  I'll grant that appointing a creationist to give the invocation is not exactly the same as appointing him science adviser, but if it represents the "spirit" of Mr. Obama's administration, then I am not, shall we say, optimistic that Mr. Obama is truly the agent for change that he purports to be. His science appointments, I thought, have mostly been good ones, but I am utterly appalled by his inviting a homophobic creationist to deliver the invocation at his inauguration.
