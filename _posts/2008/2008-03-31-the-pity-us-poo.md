Watching the whole Expelled debacle as it has unfolded, with screwups ranging from the expulsion of PZ 
and the pre-expulsion of Genie Scott who was also in the film (hear her story about 3/4 through [this podcast](http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=140) also linked by Tim Sandefur below), to the multiple mutually inconsistent stories manufactured by Mark Mathis and his Swift Boat Veterans for Truth public relations firm, I am beginning to believe that they are following a conscious strategy: the "Pity Us Because We're So Incompetent" strategy.

The most recent move in that cunning campaign was to "accidentally" send the email list for their scheduled Tempe, AZ, preview [to Scienceblogger John Lynch](http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2008/03/even_m7pmore_on_expelled_in_te.php).  Because the promoters of Expelled used cc: rather than bcc:, John was privileged to learn that such luminaries as "boughtbythecross," "homeschoolma," and "covenant-dad" are among the target audience for Expelled.

C'mon, folks.  Can you really believe that grown-up people who cross streets on their own and who (presumably) don't require full-time home care can really screw up so royally so often?  I really think they are angling for the pity vote.

By the way, in the podcast linked above Genie announced that NCSE will be releasing a series of new videos on www.expelledexposed.com on April 15.  Link to it early and often.
