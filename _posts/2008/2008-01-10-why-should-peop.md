Ron Bailey has [an article at _Reason_](http://reason.com/news/show/124271.html)on why people should care what political candidates think about evolution. "It is not acceptable for presidential candidates to argue that teaching religion in the guise of creationism and intelligent design in public schools should be just a local matter. Furthermore, as the foregoing court cases highlight, it is essential that a president nominate federal judges who understand the importance of maintaining the separation between church and state."
