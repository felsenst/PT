The Florida legislature is considering an "Academic Freedom Act" originating from Disco. For some background see my [earlier post](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/03/explore-the-str.html). 

The bill has passed its first [committee vote](http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=516) with amendments.  The amended bill starts as follows: 

> The Committee on Education Pre-K - 12 (Wise) recommended the  
> following amendment:

> 2 
> 
> 3 
> 
> 4 Senate Amendment (with title amendment)

> 
> 12 evolution as prescribed in Florida's Science Standards.

> 16 views regarding chemical and biological evolution.

 

As Disco is not on trial at the moment, they claim the following "Peer-Reviewed & Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated)":
[Discovery Institute claims peer reviewed support.](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2640)

And as regular readers know, they quote mine much of the rest of the scientific literature to read it as they wish. 

The entire Florida bill is reproduced below the fold.  I have a simple question for readers: how pleased (or not) is Disco with the revised bill, and why?
