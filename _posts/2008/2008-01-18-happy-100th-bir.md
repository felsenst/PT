Today is the 100th birthday of one of my greatest intellectual heroes, Jacob Bronowski, the mathematician, poet, philosopher, historian, and author of _[The Ascent of Man](http://www.amazon.com/Ascent-Man-5-set/dp/B000NDI3SK/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1200705984&amp;sr=8-1)_. [I paid tribute to him a few years ago on the _Thumb_.](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/happy-birthday-4.html) I also [wrote about him for _Liberty_magazine.](http://www.geocities.com/sande106/bronowskirev.htm)

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mIfatdNqBA) is a famous scene from _The Ascent_: the most moving in this whole marvelous show.
