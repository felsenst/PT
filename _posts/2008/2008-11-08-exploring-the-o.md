<small>[Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ribozyme](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/3cun), an example of the RNA-based catalysts that may have preceded protein enzymmes during the origin of life.</small>

The [Museum of Science at Boston](http://www.mos.org/) has a fantastic interactive web resource on the origins of life. [Exploring Lifes Origins](http://www.exploringorigins.org/index.html) has a [timeline of lifes evolution](http://www.exploringorigins.org/timeline.html) (with sliders), and pages on [understanding the RNA world](http://www.exploringorigins.org/rnaworld.html) and [building protocells](http://www.exploringorigins.org/protocell.html), with a nice [animation of protocell replication](http://www.exploringorigins.org/protocells.html). The pages have been made in collaboration with [ribozyme](http://www.exploringorigins.org/ribozymes.html) guru [Jack Szostak](http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/) and his laboratory, and there is a handy [resources page](http://www.exploringorigins.org/resources.html) for educators.

If you are interested in our current understanding of the origin of life, this is a very handy starting off point. You can explore ribozymes in more detail with [proteopedia](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/1x8w).
