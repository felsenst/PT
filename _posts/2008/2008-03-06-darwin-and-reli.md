In my ever expanding research of the topic of evolution, I ran across a resource which I would like to share with you as it helps understand, using access to primary resources, Darwin's opinion on a variety of issues. It's part of the [Darwin Correspondence Project](http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/) at the University of Cambridge and focuses on [http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/blogcategory/36/63/](http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/blogcategory/36/63/).

> Our aim is to provide a unique, complete, and reliable source of information on Darwin and religion. Darwin’s letters provide a unique resource for recovering the complexities of discussion in his own day, and for studying the impact of his theories on people from a wide range of backgrounds. The picture that Darwin’s letters present of his personal beliefs, and of the implications of his theory for religious belief generally, is much richer than that given in his published works, or indeed in most modern scholarship.

Enjoy
