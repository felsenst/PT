Two thumbs way, way up. That's my review of the review, of course. Not [Ebert's review of the movie](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/win_ben_steins_mind.html). Here's a nice quote for you:

> This film is cheerfully ignorant, manipulative, slanted, cherry-picks quotations, draws unwarranted conclusions, makes outrageous juxtapositions (Soviet marching troops representing opponents of ID), pussy-foots around religion (not a single identified believer among the ID people), segues between quotes that are not about the same thing, tells bald-faced lies, and makes a completely baseless association between freedom of speech and freedom to teach religion in a university class that is not about religion.

Someone should probably swing by Disco with a mop and clean up all the exploded head debris.
