My article “Reason And Common Ground: A Response to the Creationists’ ‘Neutrality’ Argument” will appear in the next issue of the [_Chapman Law Review_,](http://www.chapman.edu/LawReview/) which subscribers should receive in the mail in a week or so. [You can download it on SSRN.](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088905) The article is a reply to [a creationist article](http://agaperevolution.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/trask_esi_clr.pdf) that the _Chapman Law Review_published last year, entitled “Evolution, Science, And Ideology: Why The Establishment Clause Requires Neutrality in Science Classes,” by Stephen W. Trask.
