Our penpal David McMillan refers us to an article concerning <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/mysterious-freshwater-reservoir-hidden-ocean">a freshwater aquifer discovered beneath the ocean floor</a> and asks whether it is a fountain of the deep (see, for example, Genesis 1:2). I suppose maybe we could use such an aquifer when the last glacier has melted, but the article notes that the water would actually need to be desalinated, which to my mind makes it less than fresh.

My father trained me never to bet on anything other than a sure thing. Would anyone like to bet me that some creationist will proclaim that the water was left over from the Flood, after the tap was turned off (Genesis 8:2)?
