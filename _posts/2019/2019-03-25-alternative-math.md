An informant sent us <a href="https://youtu.be/Zh3Yz3PiXZw">this link</a> to a YouTube video, with the words, "More than a bit over the top, but at the same time not too different from what disputes over evolution and climate change are like." I disagree &ndash; I thought it was a splendid parody, well directed and well acted. Make sure you see the ending!
