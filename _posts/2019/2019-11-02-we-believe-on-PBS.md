Dan Phelps tells us, "It is finally official: Independent Lens on PBS is showing a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/we-believe-in-dinosaurs/">slightly shortened version</a> of the film [<a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">We Believe in Dinosaurs</a>] on PBS on February 17, 2020, at 10 pm," presumably Eastern Standard Time. He adds that the full film will become available later this month on DVD and online. The Independent Lens version is shortened by approximately 11&nbsp;min and may be seen at no cost.
