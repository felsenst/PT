<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly">Dragonfly</a> molting. The photographer writes, "Caught a dragonfly immediately after molting into final instar, still perched on its recently-vacated exoskeleton &ndash; there's something disconcerting with seeing how much an arthropod enlarges beyond its former body. I'm leaning towards this being a blue dasher, <i>Pachydiplax longipennis</i>, because that's the most common around here, but without coloration I couldn't confirm. The lack of coloration &ndash; in fact the near-total lack of pigmentation to the new exoskeleton &ndash; was the bit that drew my attention the most, because the wing muscles are plainly visible within."</figcaption>
