The film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6316506/">We Believe in Dinosaurs</a>, on which <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">we reported</a> a bit over 2 years ago, will <a href="https://sffilm.org/event/we-believe-in-dinosaurs/">open at the San Francisco Film Festival</a> in April. The film, directed by Clayton Brown and Monica Long Ross, features PT contributors Dan Phelps and David MacMillan. It was financed in part by an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/we-believe-in-dinosaurs#/">Indigogo campaign</a> that raised over $60,000 from approximately 400 contributors.<br/>

The film follows the construction of the Noah's Ark "replica" in Kentucky over a 3-year period. You may read more about it in our <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">earlier post</a>.
