That again! Someone at AIG, <i>Dr.</i> <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/bios/tommy-mitchell/">Tommy Mitchell</a>, a retired physician, has <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/creepy-crawlies/insects/peppered-moths">raised some hoary old objections</a> to Bernard Kettlewell's pioneering research on the peppered moth, <i>Biston betularia</i>. Indeed, the story is so hackneyed that Dr. Mitchell opens with the words, "Stop me if you have heard this tale before." We have heard it before, and Dr. Kettlewell (also an MD, incidentally) and his research have survived with flying colors.

Doctor Mitchell brings up an attack by Judith Hooper in her book <i>Of Moths and Men</i>. I outlined research undertaken by Ian Musgrave and me to refute Ms. Hooper in a <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/03/why-the-peppere.html">PT article </a> and expanded on it <a href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/moonshine.htm">here</a>. I will have no more to say, except that our research conclusively refutes Ms. Hooper's charges of falsifying the data, and to his credit Dr. Mitchell demands more proof. Indeed, he admits that "others involved in this area have collected data that validates Kettlewellâ€™s original conclusions." 

Then what is all the fuss about? Doctor Kettlewell's research has been validated, and Dr. Mitchell agrees that "[n]atural selection can easily be seen in nature." His conclusion? In effect, they are still moths.
