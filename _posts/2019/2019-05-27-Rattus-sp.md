These rats, probably Norway rats (see link), are active during the day, unlike most rats, which are <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52342-rats.html">nocturnal</a>. The rat that interested me was the rat with the white blotch. Domesticated animals such as horses, cows, dogs, and now foxes often show blotchy coats, whereas, as far as I know, wild animals do not. The blotched rat, then, is probably a feral rat or a descendant of a feral rat that bred with a wild rat. Is that right? Did someone irresponsibly release a domesticated rat into the neighborhood?
