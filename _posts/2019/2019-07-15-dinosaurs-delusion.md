Good article, <a href="https://www.kentucky.com/opinion/article232499697.html">Dinosaurs, depression, and delusion</a>, concerning the film, <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">We believe in dinosaurs</a>, by Linda Blackford of the Lexington Herald-Leader. The article features Dan Phelps and David MacMillan, both of whom generously contribute to PT. But do not miss the last few paragraphs, where Williamstown resident Elmer Virgil tells you all you need to know about the bounty that the "Ark" was going to bring to the area.
