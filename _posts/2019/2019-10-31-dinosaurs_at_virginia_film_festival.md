David MacMillan, an occasional PT contributor, informs us that "<a href="https://www.webelieveindinosaurs.net/">We Believe In Dinosaurs</a> had a screening this weekend [at the <a href="https://virginiafilmfestival.org/">Virginia Film Festival</a>] in Charlottesville, which went really well. We had a <a href="https://youtu.be/QtkzfCrW3CE">panel discussion</a> after the film that was a ton of fun." I have not watched it yet, but the panel discussion was chaired by <a href="https://religiousstudies.as.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/pdj5c">Paul Jones</a>, Co-Director of The Project on Religion and its Publics of the University of Virginia, and featured the filmmakers, Clayton Brown and Monica Long Ross, and also two of the subjects of the film, David MacMillan and Dan Phelps.

Mr. MacMillan adds that the film will be shown at  <a href="https://www.docnyc.net/">DOC-NYC</a> in New York City on November 13 and 14, and  they are hoping for a good turnout.  Anyone in the New York City area, please take note! 

We have, incidentally, covered the film previously <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">here</a> and <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/03/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">here</a>.
