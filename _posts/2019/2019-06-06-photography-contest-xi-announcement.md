The number of entrants in the photography contest, but by no means the quality of the photography, has been decreasing more or less monotonically with time. But it has not hit 0 â€“ so we thought we would announce the 11th annual contest, with entries accepted between June 14 and June 24, which gives you 2 weekends to polish your lenses or perfect your digital techniques. The rules will be the same as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2018/06/photography-contest-x.html">last year's</a>, except, obviously, that the dates will change. We will post a formal announcement at noon, MDT, June 14, and begin accepting entries immediately thereafter. We will choose a number of finalists and open voting for the winner at noon, June 28. The winner and the runner-up will receive a book courtesy of the <a href="https://ncse.com/">National Center for Science Education</a>.
