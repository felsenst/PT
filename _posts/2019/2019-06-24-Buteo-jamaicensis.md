<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/overview"><i>Buteo jamaicensis</i></a> &ndash; red-tailed hawk. These nestlings had been flapping their wings for several days but had not fledged when this picture was taken, 12 d ago. It looks as though they may be gone now, about the same time as last year. The <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2017/06/buteo-jamaicensis.html">parents</a> have occupied that nest for at least 3 y and have had 2 chicks each year.
