Tomorrow, February 12, is <a href="https://darwinday.org/events/"><strong>Darwin Day</strong></a>, and David Masci of the Pew Research Center has very conveniently come out with <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/11/darwin-day/">6 facts about the evolution debate</a>. You could quibble with his failure to use scare quotes over the term <i>debate</i>, but his facts are to some extent comforting. A sampling of these facts:
<br/><br/>
Fact 1. Approximately 80&nbsp;% of US adults say that "humans have evolved over time." About half of US adults think that God or someone else guided the process, which is frankly not an inherently anti-scientific position. About 20&nbsp;% of US adults think that humans have always existed their present form; that is, of course, true, because before they evolved to their present form they were not humans.
<br/> <br/>
Fact 3. Approximately 75&nbsp;% of US adults recognize that biologists think that "humans have evolved over time due to processes such as natural selection." Those who reject evolution, by contrast, are split roughly 50-50 on whether most biologists actually think that humans have evolved. In fact, 98&nbsp;% of AAAS biologists agree that humans have evolved over time. 
<br/><br/>
Fact 5. Those who are religiously observant are less likely to find that science and religion are in conflict. Two-thirds think that their own "religious beliefs do not clash with accepted scientific doctrine."
