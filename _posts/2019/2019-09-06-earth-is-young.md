The ad for the book, <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/store/product/falling-flat/?sku=10-2-519"><i>Falling Flat, A Refutation of Flat Earth Claims</i></a>, by Danny Faulkner, says somewhat breathlessly,

<blockquote>There are people in the world today who believe the world is flat. And they are working very hard to convince everyone else that it’s flat – even if it means distorting the truth to do it. Read this book and get the facts regarding the flat earth fallacy.</blockquote>

I have not read the book, but I have read the article, "<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/earth/reflections-flat-earth-movement/">Reflections on the flat-earth movement</a>," by the same author, and I can tell you with a fair degree of certainty, just replace "flat" with "young" wherever you see it, and you will get a pretty good refutation of the young-earth movement. If you do not believe me, try it with the quotation:

<blockquote>There are people in the world today who believe the world is <strike>flat</strike> young. And they are working very hard to convince everyone else that it’s <strike>flat</strike> young – even if it means distorting the truth to do it. Read this book and get the facts regarding the <strike>flat</strike> young earth fallacy.</blockquote>

If you have $15 to burn, you may preorder the book <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/store/product/falling-flat/?sku=10-2-519">here</a>, but frankly I would rather you gave your money to the <a href="https://ncse.com/">National Center for Science Education</a>.
