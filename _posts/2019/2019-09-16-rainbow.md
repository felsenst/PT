Lesley Smith posted this picture on Facebook. I had never seen a rainbow in which the colors were so bright and, in particular, well differentiated. In most rainbows, the colors sort of blur into one another. I suspected that the colors were so sharp because the raindrops were comparatively large; exceptionally large droplets would give rise to minimal diffraction and thus blur the colors less than in more prosaic rainbows. Small droplets give rise to a large diffraction angle and can blur the colors to the point where the rainbow appears white (alas, I have never seen a white rainbow, but I have read about them). The sky was also very clear, so there was minimal scattering by particulates in the air.

I took to the Web, and <a href="https://eo.ucar.edu/rainbows/">NCAR came to the rescue</a>. Buried, I am afraid, under a heading about supernumerary arcs, they note, without explanation,

<blockquote>The "purity" of the colors of the rainbow depends on the size of the raindrops. Large drops (diameters of a few millimeters) give bright rainbows with well defined colors; small droplets (diameters of about 0.01 mm) produce rainbows of overlapping colors that appear nearly white.</blockquote>

This photograph also shows, incidentally, that the sky is very much brighter inside the arc than outside, because the sky outside the arc lies beyond the critical angle.
