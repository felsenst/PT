The videos from the 2019 Evolution Meetings held June 21-25 in Providence, Rhode Island
have now been posted.  The web site of the meeting is <a href="https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.  It is a joint meeting of three societies, the
American Society of Naturalists, the Society of Systematic Biologists, and the
Society for the Study of Evolution.  369 videos, mostly of 15-minute
contributed talks, but some of major one-hour talks, will be found <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjWLdxl3FmovYtO53lU0SBw/videos"><strong>here</strong></a>.

They will give you a good picture of contemporary work, mostly by North
American researchers,
in evolutionary biology.  For works that are more concentrated on molecular
evolution, see also the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, which met
July 21-25 in Manchester, U.K.  Their meeting website is <a
href="http://smbe2019.org"><strong>here</strong></a>.  They have abstracts of
the talks and posters available, but no videos.  The European Society for
Evolutionary Biology will meet this year starting today (!) in Turku, Finland.
Its meeting website is <a href="https://eseb2019.fi/"><strong>here</strong></a>.

The resources from these meetings should provide some perspective on assertions
by creationists and ID advocates that contemporary evolutionary biology is a
sterile and unproductive enterprise.
