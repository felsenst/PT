<figcaption>These seem to be a pair of scaups, but I have not the foggiest idea whether lesser scaup,
<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Lesser_Scaup/"><i>Aythya affinis</i></a>, or greater scaup, <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/greater_scaup"><i>A. marila</i></a>, Wonderland Lake, Boulder, Colorado, April 6, 2019.

To my eye the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Greater_Scaup/species-compare/63896301">markings are the same</a>, right down to the black mark on the nose. Hard to tell their size, but probably smaller than mallards. Boulder is on the edge of both their ranges.  I am curious why 2 species would be so nearly identical &ndash; is there significant interbreeding, or did they simply bifurcate very recently?
