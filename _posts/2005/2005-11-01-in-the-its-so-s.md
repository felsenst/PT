Answers in Genesis is my favorite little humor site; like my own personal Onion, only the parody is lost on Ken Ham and Jon Sarfati or something.  I like to picture them as the butt of some huge Landover Baptist joke, sucking their followers dry for a [crazy museum](http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/) in what is really a diabolical leftist plot to divert fundamentalist Christian funds away from causes that are actually real controversies in the 21st century.  (Don't burst my bubble, mkay? The way I figure it, you gotta laugh or it will make you cry.)

So anyway, their newest illustrations are a riot. [Check them out here.](http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/overheads/TOC.asp)  My favorites below the fold...
