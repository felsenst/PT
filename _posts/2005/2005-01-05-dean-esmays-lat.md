I have to confess that I'm beginning to wonder why I had previously thought Dean Esmay was really interested in a reasoned discussion about ID in public schools. Following his [post](http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1103285777.shtml) of a few weeks ago asking for someone who is opposed to ID to explain the negative consequences of teaching about ID in public school science classrooms, I [replied](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2004/12/answering_dean.php) with a detailed and, I thought, compelling essay. No reply from Dean, who was informed that I had attempted to answer his question. Then in returning to his blog to see if he had ever bothered to respond, I found [this post](http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1103978156.shtml), which contains the absolutely bizarre claim that the idea that mutation can drive rapid evolutionary change "flies in the face of most evolutionary theory". I [replied](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2004/12/does_dean_esmay.php) and pointed out that the article that he had linked to did not, in any way whatsoever, posit anything that "flew in the face" of evolution, and in fact that what was found was perfectly consistent with evolution and exactly the sort of research that allows evolutionary scientists to explain the world's biodiversity. That made me wonder out loud whether Dean really understands evolution at all, since his statement about the theory was so far from reality. 

But his [latest post](http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1104926450.shtml) on the subject just makes me wonder if he has any interest in having an honest and reasoned look at the subject or not. Let me explain why.
