Sometime this morning the Panda's Thumb received its 500,000 visit, according to our site meter.

I just would like to offer my thanks to our many visitors.  I really appreciate the many thoughtful comments people offer.  Both the breadth and depth of my perspective have grown by being a part of (often just as a lurker) the converstaions here.

Everyone should have a round of your favorite Panda's Thumb digital beverage on me. :-)
