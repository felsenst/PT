Today, Panda's Thumb has experienced its highest traffic yet. While the daily hits were growing quite solidly, PT managed to attract over 10,000 visits with over 14,000 page views. \[oops make that 11,500 and 16,000. At this rate PT is 3 days away from a million visits\] 

Congratulations to a fantastic team. Check out the stats for [This Month](http://www.sitemeter.com/default.asp?action=stats&amp;site=sm4pandasthumb&amp;report=35)
