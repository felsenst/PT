William Dembski finally managed to find the transcript of Shallit's testimony. Since I've been correct on predicting his behavior all the way along so far, I've taken another stab at it at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/11/dembski_finds_the_transcript.php).

**Update**: Holy cow, I missed this the first time. Yesterday I asked the rhetorical question, would Dembski continue to embarrass himself in this situation regarding Shallit's testimony? Well, we have our answer. Not only is he continuing to embarrass himself, he's digging the hole even deeper. He's now compounding his dishonesty with an attempt to erase the past. He has now deleted all three of his previous posts where he made the false claim that Shallit had been pulled from testifying by the ACLU because his deposition was an "embarrassment" and a "liability" to their case, even after one of those posts got almost 100 comments in reply to it. There's no word so far on whether he will change his name to Winston Smith.

This really is dishonest behavior, there's no two ways about it. Clearly, Dembski's world is one in which he thinks he can rewrite history and no one will notice. I'm dying to hear how his toadies will defend this behavior. It's not defensible on its own, so they can only attempt to distract attention away from it with a tu quoque argument or pointing fingers at others. So let's hear what they have to say. Salvador? O'Brien? DonaldM? Let's hear you defend this dishonest and Orwellian behavior. And tell us again how it's evolution that undermines ethics and morality while you're at it.

**Update #2**: Oh, here's Dembski's latest on the subject, in a [comment](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/480#comment-13305) responding to being asked what happened to the previous posts on the subject:

> The previous postings were a bit of street theater. I now have what I needed. As for responding to Shallit and his criticisms, I have been and continue to do so through a series of technical articles under the rubric "The Mathematical Foundations of Intelligent Design" --- you can find these articles at www.designinference.com. The most important of these is titled "Searching Large Spaces." Shallit has indicated to me that he does not intend to engage that body of work: http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/155.

A bit of street theater? Okay, let me see if I understand this. Dembski engaged in a bit of "street theater" - meaning "told a lie" - to get a copy of the transcript that he could have gotten two months ago because it's been publicly available all along? And now instead of admitting to the lie, he's just erasing the evidence of it? Okay, let's call a spade a spade here. Dembski is a lying scumbag with no regard for the truth whatsoever. Period. Just when you think he's hit rock bottom, Dembski begins to tunnel.
