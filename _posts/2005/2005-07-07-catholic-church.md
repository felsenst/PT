Today the Archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Christoph Sch&ouml;nborn, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about evolution and the Catholic faith: "[Finding Design in Nature](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html?pagewanted=all)".  On a quick read the op-ed appears to place the Catholic Church in league with "intelligent design" creationism.  (I'm sure you will hear such victory cheers from the neo-Paleyists.)  However, this quick read is deceiving, since the author made some mistakes when choosing his words for a US audience.

Before getting upset at what the Archbishop wrote, consider this:

The Archbishop is not writing to align Catholic theology with the anti-evolution movement.  Instead he is writing to reaffirm the Catholic faith's commitment to theistic evolution and to eliminate any confusion that it is committed to atheistic evolution.  (I have no idea why he thought that this needed to be done.)

Compare and contrast the Archbishop's words to "[Creationism talk suggests need to revisit Catholic education](http://www.catholiccincinnati.org/tct/july0805/070805creationism.html)" in this week's Catholic Telegraph from Archdiocese of Cincinnati.
