<p>Last week, I received some delusional e-mail from <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/creationist_e_mail_phil_skell/">Phil Skell</a>, who claims that modern biology has no use for evolutionary theory.</p>

<blockquote>This will raise hysterical screeches from its true-believers. But, instead they should take a deep breath and tell us how the theory is relevant to the modern biology. For examples let them tell the relevance of the theory to learning&hellip;the discovery and function of hormones&hellip;[long list of scientific disciplines truncated]</blockquote>

<p>Dr Skell is a sad case. He apparently repeats his mantra that biology has no need of evolution everywhere he goes, and has never bothered to actually crack a biology journal open to see if biologists actually do use the theory. In my <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/creationist_e_mail_phil_skell/">reply to him</a>, I did briefly list how evolution is used in every single one of his numerous examples, but today I'm going to focus on just the one I quoted above: hormones.</p>

<p>Now I'm not an endocrinologist, and I don't usually read much in the hormone literature, so it was just chance that I stumbled across a review article on this very topic in BioEssays. My point is that you don't have to be an expert in the discipline to find evidence that Skell is completely wrong; all it takes is a casual perusal of the general scientific literature and a prepared mind (alas, I fear that creationists don't do the first and lack the second. One of the reasons I am concerned about science education in grade schools is that one of the aims of the creationist movement is to make sure our kids lack prepared minds, too.)</p>

<p>The review paper by Heyland <i>et al.</i> (2004a) is well worth looking up. It has a long introduction that covers several important themes in modern evo-devo, that I'll just summarize briefly here.</p>
