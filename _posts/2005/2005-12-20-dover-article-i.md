Burt Humburg and I wrote an article about the Dover trial that includes a lot of background information and behind-the-scenes stuff that most are probably unaware of. It will be in the next issue of Skeptic, but in light of today's ruling, Michael Shermer, the editor of the magazine, decided to make it available on their website immediately. You can see it [here](http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-12-20.html).
