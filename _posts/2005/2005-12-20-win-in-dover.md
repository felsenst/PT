The ruling should be available shortly, but I have just been informed by Robert Pennock, who testified at the Dover trial, that he has been told by the ACLU's lead attorney that the ruling is a win for the good guys. Whether that win is big or small will depend on the wording of the decision. I'll update as soon as we have the full text.
