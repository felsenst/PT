I have posted the email update from the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller.htm">U.S. Federal Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> over on the <a href="http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=96">NCSE Kitzmiller blog</a>.  There will be one of those "hastily organized press conferences" with plaintiffs and the legal team in Harrisburg sometime tomorrow, assuming the decision comes down sometime during the day.<br>
<br>
If anyone is feeling anxiety, don't.  The fact that the judge is clearly aware of the importance of the issue, allowed us to build an extensive trial record in a long trial, let in all of the relevant evidence on the history and origins of ID, and is reportedly writing a very long opinion (which means he is addressing the evidence and not ignoring it) are all good signs.
