Another old, but still relevant, quote...

> And thus, a true Theory is a Fact; a Fact is a familiar Theory. That which is a Fact under one aspect, is a Theory under another. The most recondite Theories when firmly established are Facts: the simplest Facts involve something of the nature of Theory.
> --William Whewell
> Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences (2nd ed, 1847)
