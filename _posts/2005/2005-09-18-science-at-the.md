As part of the Australian Science Festival, I went to one of the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC</a>'s Science in the Pub programs on <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/science/sweek/Event.asp?Action=View&EventID=61&rdoDatefrom=Between&drpFromDay=21&drpFromMonthYear=Aug+2005&drpToDay=22&drpToMonthYear=Aug+2005&drpState=ACT&txtEventName=&drpEventCategory=ALL&txtPageNumber=3&txtPageSize=10">The Science of Siblings</a>, in the congenial surrounds of King O'Malley's Irish Pub in Canberra. Paul Willis (another ex-palaeontologist! - not surprising as he can't spell it either) and Bernie Hobbs (pictured) led a stimulating discussion about siblings and twins.</p>

I attended with Chris Nedin (the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/archaeopteryx.html">Archaeopteryx FAQ</a>) and Jim Foley (occasional Panda's Thumb contributor and <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs">Fossil Hominids</a> author). I am a solitary panda (having been told that one of me was more than enough), Chris has a twin sister, and Jim is an "Irish twin" - he has a non-twin sibling born in the same year, so we had all the permutations covered! I did my share of chairing, and there was beer, wine and mugs of chocolates to be had. I stuck to beer and mugs of chocolates as they were more my size. The whole affair was recorded to be broadcast on national radio at some time to come. I wasn't recorded, but Chris was (he even got a laugh - although I don't know whether it was because of his comments or the fact that he's an ex-palaeontologist). </p>

Next stop is Adelaide, to visit that nice Dr Musgrave and help him tighten up his chapter on Intelligent Design. Once he heard that I was going to Adelaide, Chris has told me not to miss his Big Dick. Honestly, I've never seen someone so excited, just because Chris' Dick is over a metre long and is exhibited in the South Australian Museum! To humour him I've said I'll take a peek. All will be revealed.</p>
