<p>Remember <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001042.html">Dr Rubinstein</a>? The <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/a_historian_disgraces_himself/">historian who bloviated foolishly on evolutionary biology</a>? He has <a href="http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000427.php">replied</a> on the Social Affairs Unit site (scroll down to find it). <a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/05/professor-rubinstein-digs-himself-in.html">Orac is already on it</a>, so I don't need to say much, other than&hellip;geez. What a wanker.</p>

<p>Rubinstein is still clueless, still protests that he is not a creationist, but still makes nothing but stupid arguments ripped straight from the creationist literature. His new claim is to offer $100 to anyone showing the evolution of a new species within the next ten years. Of course, one must recall his expression of understanding of what evolution is, "one species producing an offspring which was clearly of another, different species", and his hypothetical examples of cats evolving "into cats which look like kangaroos" or a cat giving birth "to kittens which looked like raccoons".</p>
<p>As long as he's setting up ridiculous challenges based on his misunderstanding, he should have gone whole hog&mdash;if my cat<sup>*</sup> happens to give birth to a mixed litter of raccoons and kangaroos, I'm going to collect <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA341.html">Kent Hovind's $250,000 reward</a>, rather than wasting time with that piker Rubinstein's piddly $100 prize.</p>

<br /><p style="font-size:   11px; margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><sup>*</sup>Our cat, Midnight, is a neutered male, which  makes the demonstration only slightly more difficult.</p>
