The Cato Institute's Neal McCluskey has <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/01-21-05.html">this article</a> commenting on the Cobb County decision. Although I disagree that the decision was "ridiculous," I agree with McCluskey's argument that this controversy simply cannot be settled so long as government runs schools:<b> "the fight over evolution is just one of numerous struggles precipitated by a system for which all must pay, but only a select few control."</b>
