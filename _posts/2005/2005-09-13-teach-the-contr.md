Jay Bookman, deputy editorial page editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, had a [great column on September 12th](http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/bookman/2005/091205.html).  Bookman writes 


> Unfortunately, though, I don't believe ID advocates are sincere about wanting to teach the controversy. If they are, they simply haven't thought through the implications.  A controversy, remember, has two sides. And if alleged weaknesses in evolution theory are to be taught in our schools as science, then scientific evidence against the existence of an intelligent designer or God must be taught, too.  That's how science works. If you propose a theory, you issue an invitation to others to shoot holes in your theory.  So think about that: Do we really want science teachers exploring the evidence for --- _but also against_ --- the existence of a designer? I don't think that's wise or useful for a number of reasons, but that's what a rigorous and intellectually honest debate would require.

Anyone wanna bet whether or not the Discovery Institute agrees to teach **all** controversies?  I dibbs "_No_."
