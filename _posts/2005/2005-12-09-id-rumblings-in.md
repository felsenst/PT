> Although they don't all agree on the merits of intelligent design, most members of the Muscatine School District Board of Education believe that students should know about it, and they agree that it will likely be discussed by the Board within the next two years.
> 
> Ann Hart, vice president of the Muscatine School Board, said she would not remove evolution from the school district's curriculum, because of its scientific basis, but that students should also know about intelligent design.
> 
> "I think somewhere along the line, intelligent design should be brought up because a lot of people believe in it; and, otherwise, kids aren't going to understand it as well as they should," Hart said. "I don't think we should go in-depth with it, just let kids know what it's about and that it's what some people believe and then go on to evolution. I believe in evolution, for sure, but we do need to let kids know this is something that people believe."
