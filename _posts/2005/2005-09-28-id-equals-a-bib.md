During his testimony, Rob Pennock used this quote in court in support of the proposition that explicitly religious concerns are part of the substance of ID.  The quote is from Nancy Pearcey, in her recent book "Total Truth".  I had not seen it before, and it definitely deserves more attention:

"\[D\]esign theory demonstrates that Christians can sit in the supernaturalist's 'chair' even in their professional lives, seeing the cosmos through the lens of a comprehensive biblical worldview."  (Nancy Pearcey, Total Truth pp. 204-205)

Pennock argued that for ID proponents, intelligent design is intended to scientifically prove the supernatural, moving it into the realm of scientific fact.
