<p>If you've grown weary of following all of the post-election fallout, feel free to have a look at my <a href=http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/steves.html>new column</a> for CSICOP's <a href=http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/>Creation and Intelligent Design Watch</a> site.  I put to rest once and for all the idea that Stephen Jay Gould would have objected to NCSE's &ldquo;Steves&rdquo; list.  Enjoy!</p>
