While wandering the web the other day, I noticed <em><a href="http://www.cruxmag.com" target="_blank">Crux Magazine</a></em> - "determined to supply a high-quality alternative to the principle tastemakers of our target demographic, young adults aged 25 to 45 ... a creative and trailblazing entity in our own right, the embodiment of a fresh and radical perspective on culture that is gaining adherents by the day, [with the aim of] redeeming the times and redirecting the prevailing orthodoxy of our age." Stirring stuff. At the site you can read a plug for <em>Priviledged Planet</em> [<a href="http://www.cruxmag.com/asset/CRUX_privilegedplanet.html" target="_blank">link</a>] and <em>By Design or By Chance?</em> [<a href="http://www.cruxmag.com/asset/CRUX_designorchance.html" target="_blank">link</a>]. 

<p>Things get interesting when you look at the <a href="http://www.cruxmag.com/aboutcrux.html" target="_blank">Editorial Advisory Board</a>. There we see Beckwith, Budziszewski, Dembski, Johnson, Meyer, Moreland, Nelson, Reynolds, Richards, and West - a veritable cluster of Discovery Fellows and fellow travellers. Also on the list are Norm Geisler and Hugh Ross. </p>

<blockquote><p>Only Crux  is solely committed to exposing the pernicious ideologies that have degraded the American mind. Only Crux is open-minded enough to look beyond popular assumptions and locate insights that have been buried by the mainstream media. Only Crux is giving a voice to those on the margins, to the academics, scientists, celebrities, and artists who simply will not kowtow to convention or the party line.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another front in the Wedge strategy, methinks.</p>
