The big tent is only comfortable when it serves one's purpose but when the tent becomes to crowded, ID seems to be quickly back pedalling. Now ID is not only fighting science but also young earth creationism. And it is ill equipped to handle either one. 

Science because ID fails to propose a scientifically relevant theory and thus remains scientifically vacuous. Creationism because it invited it into its big tent.

Luckily scientists like Padian get to add their own comments

Flintstones, a documentary to YEC'ers. Now that is funny. YEC in the business of entertainment, now that's a novel idea. At least there is a market...
