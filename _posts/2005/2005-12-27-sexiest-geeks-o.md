[Chris Mooney](http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=2320) and [Judge John Jones III](http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/bios/jones.htm) made the top 10.  [Prof. Steve Steve](http://prof.stevesteve.org/) attributes his loss to anti-panda discrimination due to the bad press surrounding _Of Pandas and People_, which he tells us emphatically he was _not_ on the cover of.  Steve Steve still plans to make the cover of the [2006 Studmuffins of Science](http://www.s-t.com/daily/12-95/12-04-95/scistud.htm) calendar.
