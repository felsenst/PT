It appears that a number of scientists and educators [turned out for public hearings](http://www.adn.com/news/education/story/6590802p-6474520c.html) on Alaska's new science standards last week, and they educated both the board and the media in the process.

It would be nice if every newspaper was this smart about the creationists' "teach the controversy" strategy:

> Without much fuss, the Alaska Board of Education put an essential bit of science back into the state science standards last Friday. That was thanks to more than a bit of civil discussion that took place the day before.
> 
> \[...\] 
> 
> But to teach the "evolution vs. intelligent design" controversy in science classes would give too much weight to ideas that haven't earned their scientific keep. There are better challenges to evolution on scientific grounds.
> 
> That does not mean evolution is only a hypothesis. As speakers at last week's Alaska Board of Education hearing on state science standards pointed out, the theory of evolution is as sound scientifically as the theory of gravity. Both raise unanswered questions, but they are generally accepted in the world of science, acted upon in real life and, most of all, supported by the preponderance of evidence.
> 
> The serious scientific challenges to evolution or Darwinism are not from creationists or intelligent design theorists who draw their inspiration from faith, but from scientists who draw their conclusions from evidence. Evolution is sound theory, not fixed dogma. It can both withstand and profit by continued scrutiny and revision.
>

While we're on the subject of Alaska, be sure to check out the [website of Alaska artist Ray Troll (www.trollart.com)](http://www.trollart.com).  He did the shark image in this post, and he does some great art on ocean biology, fossils, and [evolution](http://www.trollart.com/evo.html).

Also, the [Evolution 2005 meeting](http://www.evolution05.uaf.edu/default.cfm) [has been going on](http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,1413,113~7244~2917363,00.html) up in Fairbanks.  I suspect PT poster Reed Cartwright, who is [at the meetings](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001109.html), will have a report at some point.

For posterity, here are some previous news articles on evolution and the Alaska science standards, from the _Anchorage Daily News_ and elsewhere.  _ADN_ reporter George Bryson deserves a lot of credit for putting the issue on the map in Alaska back in 2004.
