You get one guess after this hint: it starts with "E."  That's right, it's _evolution_, and it is based on all of the remarkable advances in evolution in 2005, such as the comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which just happens to have been [featured in the _Kitzmiller_ trial](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1am2.html#day1am429).  I'm still hoping _Science_ reprints a chunk of Jones's opinion, like they [printed the _McLean_ opinion](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0036-8075%2819820219%293%3A215%3A4535%3C934%3ACISTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U) in 1982.

**Update:** The full issue is now [online](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol310/issue5756/index.dtl).  Holy moly, [Jawless Fish Have Form of Adaptive Immunity](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5756/1892b).  That's big news if you're into that kind of thing.
