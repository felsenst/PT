Well, Answers in Genesis Ministries, whom a Discovery Institute spokesman has referred to as "guitar-strumming hillbillies," have produced [their response](http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2005/0120cobb.asp) to Judge Cooper's decision in the Cobb Country disclaimer-sticker case.  It echoes (borrows, steals?) much of the Discovery Institute's spin which [I have already dispatched](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000740.html).  I'll make three points again.


* The judge found that the disclaimer-stickers hurt biology education and did not foster critical thinking, despite the board's best intentions.
* In fact, he found that the disclaimer-stickers hurt education in such a way that only sectarian interests (creationism et al.) benefited.  This caused a violation of the Lemon test.
* The decision is neither activist nor bizarre.  All Lemon prongs must be satisfied, not just one.
