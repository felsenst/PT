That may sound strange to rational people, but if you visit a diner in Dunlap, Tennessee, you'll find out that it's perfectly plausible.  It appears that Kent Hovind, aka [Dr. Dino](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000156.html), isn't content with poisoning the minds of children down in Pensacola, Florida.  He's now wormed his way north to the land of Scopes.  Joe Meert, a geologist and long-time follower of creationism, had this discovery to share on the [IIDB](http://www.iidb.org/vbb/showthread.php?t=121381&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25) forum:

> I took a group of students on a field trip to Tennessee, NC and Virginia. We stopped at a small diner in Tennessee for breakfast. My 7 year old son was with me on the trip and as the waitress was setting our table, she put down a 'childrens activity' place mat. I did not think much of it until my son said, "Dad, did you know that T-rex could breathe fire?". I said where did you hear that? He said, look at my placemat. I did and there were many other 'fun-filled' dino facts from one "Dr Dino"!! 

He's done us favor of scanning the placemats:

There's not much more that needs saying.  The kiddie script is just so appropriate.
