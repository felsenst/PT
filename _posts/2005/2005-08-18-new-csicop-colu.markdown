<p>My most <a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/probability-one.html>recent column</a> for CSICOP's <a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/>Creation Watch</a> website is now available.  I'm talking about mathematics for a change, specifically the attempts by creationists to use probability theory to refute evolution.  Be warned, however, that this is part one of a two-part column.  So don't be too annoyed by the cliffhanger at the end!</p>
