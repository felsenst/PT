<p><a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/probability-two.html>Part Two</a> of my column about probability and evolution is now avaialable at CSICOP's <a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/>Creation Watch</a> site.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>In <a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/probability-one.html>part one</a> I considered the classic anti-evolution arguments based on probability theory, and showed why they failed.  In part two we disucss why it is no improvement to add &ldquo;specification&rdquo; to the mix.  We also examine some of the ways probability theory can be used legitimately to shed light on evolution.</p>
