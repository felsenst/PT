Well, this is so brilliant I just had to post it: [Ten Questions to Ask Your History Teacher](http://www.someareboojums.org/blog/?p=21), a parody of Jonathan Wells's "[Ten Questions to Ask Your Biology Teacher](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=ten+questions+wells)", which is based on Wells's book _Icons of Evolution_, which is thoroughly dismantled [here](http://www.ncseweb.org/icons/) and [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/).
