<p>Adam Felbers has a hilarious take on the ID movement, <a href="http://www.felbers.net/mt/archives/000986.html">a Q&amp;A on the theory of Intelligent Design</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q: So what is ID doing to research the identity and characteristics of this "intelligence" that it posits?</i><br />
A:  Well, nothing that I've found yet...</p>

<p><i>Q: Because if they really wanted to research stuff, they'd be saying things like, "Well, could a giant lobster make a flower?" and, "Is there anything about the design of DNA that looks like something a space crustacean would come up with?"</i><br />
A:  I really think you need to get off this whole lobster thing.</p>

<p><i>Q: But these ID guys aren't looking into just who this intelligence is, are they?</i><br />
A:  No.</p>

<p><i>Q: Because they think it's God, right?</i><br />
A:  They don't say that.</p>

<p><i>Q: Because if they thought they saw evidence of giant superintelligent eyestalks peering down on them from under a celestial carapace, they'd be seriously bummed, wouldn't they?</i><br />
A:  I think this Q&amp;A is over now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's funny because it is so, so true.</p>
