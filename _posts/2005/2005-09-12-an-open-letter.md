An open letter to the [600 NCSE Steves](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3541_project_steve_2_16_2003.asp),

My dearest, my darlings, you little stinkers! In all of my 25 plus years as a professional something or other, (and believe me, I've done a lot of stuff for money!) nothing makes me prouder than to have been involved in what became known internationally as [Project Steve](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3541_project_steve_2_16_2003.asp). Oh, poo to project lead on one of BellSouth's largest re-engineering software projects of the late 90s, GE Financial Services first venture into the World Wide Web and Bechtel Engineering's Web Initiative Plan what'cha'ma'call'it. Project Steve beat the pants off all of them. 

From the moment that Matt Inlay first pondered the vastness of Steves (individually or collectively, only Matt himself knows), Glenn and I fell giggling onto the floor of the NCSE office munching Twinkies and causing the [Darwinian-Only](http://www.cafepress.com/aus_ed/829041) Terror herself, Dr. Eugenie Scott, to come from her lair and roar, "C'mon guys, what's so funny," we knew we were on to something.

At first we thought it just too outrageous to even contemplate. After all, who were these so-called Steves? Botanists, geologists, paleontologists, biologists, tobacconists? Would they answer our call? Well, my boys, you did answer. With all the courage and conviction of someone who would send an email to a colleague stating, "Hey Steve, did you get one of these? Are the clowns at NCSE serious about this?" you charged to the front trenches defending quality science education.
