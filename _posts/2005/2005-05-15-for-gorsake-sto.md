It's difficult not to laugh at the Discovery Institute, with their
transparent attempts to pretend that they don't have a religious agenda, and
[their nonstop media spinning](http://www.evolutionnews.org).
Recently there's been the hilarity of the Kansas Board of Education hearings.
Before that there was the claim by DI fellow Jay Richards, a
philosopher and theologian, that he thought there was [a problem with the theory of relativity](http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?p=179&amp;more=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1), based on his reading of
magazine articles.

In [Paul Myers' words](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/thats_how_it_is/), it's like "a circus where they've fired all the acrobats
and animal trainers and it's clowns, clowns, clowns all the time".

It would all be very funny if it wasn't so serious. Even though ID may be
dead in the water scientifically, it is a real threat to science education,
and ID-friendly initiatives are popping up all over the United States.

All of which gives me an excuse to present the following cartoon, the
caption of which seems appropriate. This is a classic Australian cartoon
from 1933:
