The _Boston Globe_ has just published a [puff-piece](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/27/the_evolution_of_george_gilder?mode=PF) on George Gilder.  The article is called, "[The evolution of George Gilder](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/27/the_evolution_of_george_gilder?mode=PF)." Anyway, the piece mostly just lets Gilder spout unchallenged about how evolution can't explain genetic "information", although it does start off OK by mentioning Pharyngula's [2004 fisking](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/the_sanctimonious_bombast_of_george_gilder/) of a Gilder essay in _Wired_.  For some reason, though, the reporter couldn't bring himself to make one tiny little phone call to a biologist (I'm sure [PZ Myers](http://pharyngula.org/) was ready and willing) to learn how evolution [actually can produce new genes with new functions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Display&amp;dopt=pubmed_pubmed&amp;from_uid=14634634) ([handy free pdf](http://www3.uta.edu/faculty/betran/naturereviews.pdf)).  Gilder is saying something that is the equivalent of saying "scientists don't know [how volcanos form](http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/cover2.html)."  Saying that the origin of new genetic information requires divine intervention [is just wrong](http://www.evowiki.org/index.php/Evolution_of_new_information), anyone who believes it is badly uninformed, [and](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/dembski.html) [anyone](http://www.touchstonemag.com/docs/issues/15.5docs/15-5pg40.html) [who](http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=9;t=6) [promotes](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2177) [the](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/gitt.html) [idea](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/spetner.html) to the innocent public is a deluded pseudoscientist.

To end on a positive note, Gilder does manage to get [one thing right](http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/07/27/the_evolution_of_george_gilder?mode=PF): 

> "What's being pushed is to have Darwinism critiqued, to teach there's a controversy. Intelligent design itself does not have any content."
