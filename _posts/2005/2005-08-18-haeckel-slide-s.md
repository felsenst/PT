The commentary touches on the most controversial aspects of Haeckel's legacy (doctored embryo drawings, racism, etc), but with the aid of some truly stunning pictures, it does a good job at offering a balanced look at this amazingly gifted scientist and artist.  

Interestingly, [a movie](http://www.frif.com/new2004/pro.html) based largely on Haeckel's story is about to come out.  Too bad the casting was done long ago, because judging from the photograph in Slate's second slide (reproduced here, Haeckel on the left), with a wig and a fake beard Dembski would have been a shoo-in for Haeckel's part.
