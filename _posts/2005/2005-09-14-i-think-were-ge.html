<p>Bill Dembski, the Newton of Information Theory, has announced a new flash game on his site, <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/darwinalia/panda-monium.swf">Panda-monium</a>. It's a sort of Space Invaders-like game, where you shuffle a tank back and forth, firing upwards at&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;panda bears falling out of the sky.</p>

<p>It's interesting because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's slick and flashy, </li>
<li>but it's also shallow and tedious,</li>
<li>and the pandas always eventually win.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a metaphor there somewhere.</p>
