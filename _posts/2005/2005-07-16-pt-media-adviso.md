Given the high media profile of discussions about evolutionary biology and educational policy for public schools, several of the Panda's Thumb contributors have agreed to make themselves available for representatives of the media. PT contributors often have credentials and expertise in relevant fields, or long experience in analyzing the arguments presented by various antievolutionary groups. The following list gives concise background information about each member of the Panda's Thumb Media Advisory Panel.
