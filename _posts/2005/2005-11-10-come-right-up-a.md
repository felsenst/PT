<p>Apparently Pastafarians don't have any rules about idolatry, because over on ebay, a [a Handmade Flying Spaghetti Monster Plush Doll](http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=6011889705) has received 36 bids and is currently selling for $242.50.  I don't even know who is running the auction, but evidently all proceeds (which will be matched by the dollmaker's employer) will be donated to [NCSE](http://www.ncseweb.org), which by the way [is something you should consider doing](http://www.natcenscied.org/membership.asp) anyway if you [support our mission](http://www.ncseweb.org/about.asp).</p>
