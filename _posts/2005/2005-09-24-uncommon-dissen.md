PhilVaz has re-tooled a version of Pac-Man as ["Uncommon Dissent"](http://www.bringyou.to/games/UncommonDissent.htm), with the little yellow protagonist as "Dembski", and head shots of Ken Miller, Genie Scott, Richard Dawkins, and a panda become the "ghosts". You get an extra "Dembski" with every 10,000 points scored...

As with previous ID games, they always lose, eventually.
