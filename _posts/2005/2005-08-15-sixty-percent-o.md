I just finished watching [Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anchorman/), a Will Ferrell flick about a local news anchor living in my beloved city of San Diego during the 70s.  There's a great exchange between Ron and his co-anchor Veronica Corningstone that perfectly captures what it feels like at times arguing with creationists.

> Ron Burgundy: Discovered by the Germans in 1904, they named it _San Diago_, which of course in German means "a whale's vagina". 
> 
> Veronica Corningstone: No, there's no way that's correct.
> 
> Ron: I'm sorry, I was trying to impress you. I don't know what it means. I'll be honest, I don't think anyone knows what it means anymore. Scholars maintain that the translation was lost hundreds of years ago. 
> 
> Veronica: Doesn't it mean _Saint_ Diego? 
> 
> Ron: No. No. 
> 
> Veronica: No, that's - that's what it means. Really. 
> 
> Ron: Agree to disagree.
