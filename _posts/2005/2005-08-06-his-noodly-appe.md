PT [recently reported](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/the_discovery_i.html) that the Discovery Institute [has hired](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/08/the_discovery_i.html) the [PR firm](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Creative_Response_Concepts) behind the 2004 "[Swiftboat Veterans for 'Truth'](http://www.swiftvets.com/)" ad campaign.  Based on the following comparison of graphics, it looks like the Noodlers, the devotees of the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://www.venganza.org/) who are campaigning to get [His Noodly Appendage](http://www.venganza.org/) into the [Kansas Science Standards](http://www.kcfs.org/), have followed suit.

You can get this on [T-shirts and everything](http://www.cafepress.com/venganza/750239). I am sure that "Swiftboat Veterans for His Noodly Appendage" is just a matter of time...
