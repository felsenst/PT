Wildernesse (Tiffany) is a beautiful law student who just happens to be married to a handsome evolutionary biologist.  Today in her class on education law they discussed evolution and creationism.  She has written about it on her blog, [go check it out](http://www.wildernesse.us/archives/2005/10/280.html).

> Oh well.  I wish people were more educated.  I'm not even well-educated on this subject, but I know that a lot of what is spouted off out there is nonsense.  (My definition of well-educated for laypersons is whether you can explain a frequency-dependent selection model, a phylogenetic tree, and why humans are taxonomically classified as an ape.  If you can't do those things, what makes you think you know enough?  I am arbitrary and I love it.)  I wish people didn't feel they had to cram their religious beliefs into a stunted mold and become blind to the utterly awe-inspiring natural mechanisms of our world.  Let God out of the box.
