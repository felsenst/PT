<p><a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/10/10/florida_where_the_living_is_contradictory.php">Carl Zimmer examines the situation in Florida</a>, bringing up Yecke and Jeb Bush and the interesting conundrum that while they are trying to pander to the Intelligent Design creationists, they have also enticed the Scripps Institute to open a Florida branch campus.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don't know how long Florida will be able to go on this way, trying to attract the biotech industry while its leading state officials try to teach its students that creationism is an equally valid way of understanding life. Sooner or later, something's got to give.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can't encourage ignorance while trying to reap the benefits of knowledge for long. That's the balancing act the creationist-friendly politicians are trying to play, though; I think they're just hoping they can keep wrecking the foundation now, and that everything will collapse <i>after</i> they're safely out of office.</p>
