The Society for the Study of Evolution, which is ironically based in Kansas, has redone their website: [ http://www.evolutionsociety.org](http://www.evolutionsociety.org).  The website contains information about evolution and science education, statements from scientific societies on evolution, a white paper on evolution and society, and many more interesting things.

> The objectives of the Society for the Study of Evolution are the promotion of the study of organic evolution and the integration of the various fields of science concerned with evolution.
> 
> The Society publishes the scientific journal _Evolution_ and holds annual meetings in which scientific findings on evolutionary biology are presented and discussed.

The Society for the Study of Evolution holds its annual meeting with [The Society of Systematic Biolologists](http://systbiol.org) and [The American Society of Naturalists](http://www.amnat.org).  This conference is simply called "Evolution."  [Evolution 2005]( http://www.evolution05.uaf.edu/ ) is at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks and begin June, 10th.

I will be attending the conference and presenting some of my doctoral research on simulating sequence evolution.  [Prof. Steve Steve](http://prof.stevesteve.org) will be traveling with me to the conference and will be at my talk (early Sunday morning) if anyone wants to meet him.
