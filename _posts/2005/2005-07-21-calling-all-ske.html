<p>Much to appeal to the scientifically minded is coming up on the weblogs.</p>

<p>First, The <a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/thirteenth-meeting-of-skeptics-circle.html">thirteenth Skeptics' Circle</a> is available for reading right now at <a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/">Respectful Insolence</a>. This is <i>the</i> weblog carnival for critical thinking.</p>

<p>Second, the second <a href="http://www.charliesbirdblog.com/">I and the Bird</a> is up&mdash;I'm impressed. It's long. There must be an awful lot of birdwatchers out there, blogging away.</p>

<p>Third, there is another <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">Tangled Bank</a> coming up next Wednesday at <a href="http://evolgen.blogspot.com/">evolgen</a>. If you've written anything on science or natural history, send a link to <a href="mailto:">evolgen@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a>, or <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">pzmyers@pharyngula.org</a>, and we'll make sure to talk about your writing.</p>


<p>Finally, I've managed to volunteer myself to host <a href="http://blogborygmi.blogspot.com/2004/09/grand-rounds-archive-upcoming-schedule.html">Grand Rounds</a> next Tuesday. Now you may be thinking to yourself, "Myers is no MD; what are his qualifications to host a collection of posts by <i>real</i> doctors and nurses?" I'll have you know, though, that I am an accomplished neurosurgeon&hellip;it's just that all of my patients have been fish and insect embryos, and none of them have ever survived the operation. Keep that in mind as you  <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">submit your carefully crafted medblog articles</a> to my caring hands.</p>
