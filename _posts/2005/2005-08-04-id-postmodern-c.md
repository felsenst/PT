_(**Note:** This is the first post in the new "Evolution of Creationism" category.  Since the "intelligent design" movement [actively obfuscates its creationist origins](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=1329), tracing the true origins of "intelligent design" is crucial to understanding what ID is really about, and to understanding the dire peril ID faces in the upcoming court case _[Kitzmiller v. Dover](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rncse_content/vol24/4838_design_on_trial_in_dover_penn_12_30_1899.asp)_.)_

Earlier today, [Steve Reuland](/archives/2005/08/wapo-on-the-pre.html) discussed an [excellent _Washington Post_ essay](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/03/AR2005080301817.html) ("[But Is It Intelligent?](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/03/AR2005080301817.html)") making the connection between the [Intelligent Design Creationism](http://www.discovery.org/csc/) and [postmodernism](http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/postmodern/). [As discussed in the comments](/archives/2005/08/wapo-on-the-pre.html#c41329) to Steve's post, it wasn't surprising that the _Washington Post_ picked up on the postmodernism connection, given that it was highlighted in the _Post_'s [profile of Phillip Johnson](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001043.html) back in May 2005.

But if you are looking for slam-dunk proof that ID is just creationism in a postmodern, relativist tuxedo, look no further than [Nancy Pearcey](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=44&amp;isFellow=true)'s interview with Phillip Johnson in the June 1990 _Bible-Science Newsletter_.\*  Speaking of his upcoming book, [_Darwin on Trial_](http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/johnson.html), Johnson told Pearcey,

> "We must not forget that the controversy over Darwinism has a sociological or political dimension.  Philosophers of science have developed a very relativist approach to knowledge claims.  It is now regarded as a commonplace in the field that there is a "sociology of knowledge" and that an intimate relationship exists between knowledge and power \[sic\*\*\].  What is presented as objective knowledge is frequently an ideology that serves the interests of some powerful group.  The curious thing is that the sociology-of-knowledge approach has not yet been applied to Darwinism.  That is basically what I do in my manuscript."

Game, set, match.

**Notes**

\* NCSE just happens to have a 12-year collection of the _Bible-Science Newsletter_ in its archives, stretching from 1982 to the _Newsletter_'s apparent discontinuation in 1994.  The _Newsletter_ was a rabid young-earth creationist publication, full of reports on the hunt for Noah's Ark on Mt. Ararat, and alleged evidence of dinosaurs living with humans.  Young-earth creationist [Nancy Pearcey](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=44&amp;isFellow=true) was a contributing editor to the _Newsletter_ for many years, before coauthoring [_Of Pandas and People_](http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21) and [joining the Discovery Institute ID program](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=44&amp;isFellow=true).  

Believe it or not, this Phillip Johnson quote doesn't even scratch the surface of the wealth of proto-ID material that was published in the _Bible-Science Newsletter_ between 1982 and 1994.  Stay tuned to PT for more revelations.

\*\* In the original, it appears that a word was accidentally left in or out of this sentence.  Probably it should read, "It is now regarded as commonplace..." or "It is now regarded as a commonplace observation..."
