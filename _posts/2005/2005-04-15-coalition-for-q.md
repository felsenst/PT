This morning four Kansas organizations, including Kansas Citizens for Science, announced the formation of a coalition in support of the state science standards committee's work and opposing the kangaroo court hearings in May.  The coalition released a position paper which states in part:

>  We urge all Kansans to join us in adopting the following positions:
> 
> 1.    We request that the State Board of Education adopt the final draft of the standards offered later this spring by the writing committee, without revisions.
> 
> 2.   We request that the State Board of Education cancel all special opportunities for the Intelligent Design minority to present their views. We especially urge the Board to cancel the so-called "science hearings" scheduled in May.  The minority proposals were considered and rejected by a two-thirds majority of the science standards writing committee. The BOE should accept that and give the minority group no further special privileges.
