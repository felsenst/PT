Why not just have women reproduce asexually, and bloom into pregnancy automatically as soon as they hit puberty? That would be much more efficient. Sex also has the problem of breaking up good gene combinations; as you may or may not know, my wife is <i>perfect</i>, but in order to reproduce, she has to water down her flawless genes by combining them with those of a lesser member of the species, me. And then of course, there's the problem of us males. We could instantly double the reproductive capacity of our population if all males were equipped with uteruses and could also bear children. It's a weird, weird system.</p>
