One of the interesting segments of the Michael Behe cross examination begins on page 42 of the Day12AM transcript, and it concerns a paper that Behe wrote with David Snoke. That paper, called _Simulating Evolution by Gene Duplication of Protein Feature that Requires Multiple Amino Acid Residues_, was based upon a computer simulation that attempted to answer the question of how long it would take cumulative point mutations in a single gene to produce a new trait - the interaction of two proteins - requiring a change in multiple amino acid residues _if_ there was no selective advantage to preserve any of the individual mutations until they were all present and the final result was fully functional. For Behe, this is a [simple example](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/57_part_06_dr_michael_behe_10_31_2002.asp) of irreducible complexity:

> Thus in order for a protein that did not have a disulfide bond to evolve one, several changes in the same gene have to occur. Thus in a sense, the disulfide bond is irreducibly complex, although not really to the same degree of complexity as systems made of multiple proteins.

This paper has been lauded by ID advocates as an excellent example of ID-stimulated research. The DI has [listed it](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2190&amp;program=CSC-News&amp;callingPage=discoMainPage) as an example of genuine peer reviewed research that supports ID. William Dembski has declared that Behe and Snoke's research "may well be the nail in the coffin \[and\] the crumbling of the Berlin wall of Darwinian evolution." Unfortunately for them, this paper didn't hold up well under questioning during the Dover trial.
