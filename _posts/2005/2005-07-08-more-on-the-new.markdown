Todd Zywicki has <a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_07_03-2005_07_09.shtml#1120775700">this post</i> about the <i>New Republic</i> article, that I think makes some good points.

<strong>Update: </strong><a href="http://frum.nationalreview.com/archives/07112005.asp#069097">David Frum says</a> his answers were misreported.
