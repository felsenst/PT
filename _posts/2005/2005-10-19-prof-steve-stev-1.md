How about showing it this Halloween?

Dress up as the fuzzy professor for Halloween and send us a photo to enter the costume contest.  Worthy entries will receive prizes like t-shirts or maybe a visit from the Professor himself.

To submit your photo, upload it to the Internet and place a link to its location in a comment to this post.  You must give us a way to contact you in your comment either an email or a link to a site with an email address.

(Note that the actual prize has not been decided yet.)
