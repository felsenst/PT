Daniel Morgan has written a [very thorough review](http://danielmorgan.blogspot.com/2005/12/sternberg-saga-continues.html) of the entire Richard Sternberg situation and it's well worth reading. Sternberg, you may recall, was the editor of a journal who went outside the normal peer review process to insure that a very badly written paper by DI fellow Stephen Meyer would get published. Morgan debunks the whole Sternberg-as-martyr myth that has grown up around it.
