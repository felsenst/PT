We've all heard the Creationist refrain (also a Dennis Miller joke), "If humans evolved from Monkeys, Why are there still Monkeys?"

See http://our.homewithgod.com/whereeaglesdare/darwin.htm for a badly spelled example:


> Darwin claims that because we are similar to monkeys in some ways, then we must have evolved from them. So whay are there still monkeys around then?

This aphorism is also discussed [here](http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/If_we&apos;re_descended_from_apes,_why_are_there_still_apes_around%3F), [here](http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_noway.htm#11), [here](http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/faq/dont_use.asp#apes), [here](http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mevolution.html), [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat03.html),  and most bizarrely [here](http://www.vibrani.com/cloning.htm).

As a Friday Treat, I'm posting a Torte and a Re-Torte about this curious argument.
