Amazingly, Witt continues his [fallacious arguments](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/12/message_to_rush_limbaugh_the_m.html#more) and further undermines the Discovery Institute's official position as submitted to the Court in its Amicus Brief

First problem: Judge Jones did not argue that scientific arguments must be ruled out because these scientists are also interested in overthrowing Darwinism. Anyone who has read the actual decision would realize that the Judge's ruling on Intelligent Design not being science was based on the vacuity of the ID arguments.

Thus the conclusion in the second paragraph about the consequences of Judge Jones' ruling is based on a false premise and should be rejected. 

ID has been rejected as a science not because of the religious beliefs of its proponents but because of its scientific vacuity. In its filing of the Amicus Brief, the Discovery Institute argued that the primary effect of teaching ID was not necessarily religious and that ID was in fact scientific. Since the question of ID being science was essential to the ruling, Judge Jones ruled appropriately.

I appreciate that this may be hard to accept. But why is this so hard to understand?
