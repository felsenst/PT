The [**2005 Megacreation Conference**](http://www.answersingenesis.org/events/megaconference/schedule.aspx) is scheduled to start July 17, in Lynchburg, Virginia.

The conference website is co-sponsored by [Answers in Genesis](http://www.answersingenesis.org) and [Liberty University](http://www.liberty.edu), and is aimed at: "Equipping Christians to defend and proclaim the Gospel in today's culture! Featuring a stunning lineup of the world's greatest minds in creation apologetics presenting their premier presentations."  

I would suggest that we try and get someone from the east coast to go and give reports to PT, but the conference is running for **five days straight** and I'm not sure anyone would want to spend their whole summer vacation at a YEC conference.
