Leon Satterfield descibes in [The president and 'intelligent design'](http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2005/08/29/letters/doc43125f87173b2366532956.txt) a goofy id(ea):

He also apparently doesn't know --- or more likely doesn't care --- that we were founded as a secular nation. No national church, no religious creeds we had to pretend to subscribe to.

From the [Christian Century](http://www.christiancentury.org/article.lasso?id=1200) editorial page we read that

In other words, ID is poor science and reduces God to hide in the gaps of our ignorance (poor theology).

Seems that the media, including the Christian media, has figured out that the 'emperor has no clothes'
