In _Academe_ magazine (which I'm sure everyone has on their coffee table), there's a new article out by Barbara Forrest and Glenn Branch:

[Wedging Creationism into the Academy](http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/2005/05jf/05jfforr.htm).

Kind of an all-around smack-down on the ID movement, the Wedge, etc.  Most readers here will be familiar with the information presented therein, but it combines a lot of diverse sources into a single (and brief) document.  So it's a good reference.  And if you know someone who's not familiar with the ID movement, it's a good introduction.
