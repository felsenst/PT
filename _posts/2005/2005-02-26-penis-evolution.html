<blockquote><p>Amniote penises have had a complex history. They have evolved independently multiple times, and perhaps most troubling to the male ego, they have been secondarily <i>lost</i> at least a few times. And every time they have evolved, they converge on a remarkably similar morphological solution.</p></blockquote>
