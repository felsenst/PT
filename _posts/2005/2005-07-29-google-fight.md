Under the heading "Stupid Web Tricks" file the following:

[Google fight](http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=evolution&amp;word2=intelligent+design) between Evolution and Intelligent Design.

(No Darwin dolls were harmed in the making of this demonstration.)

Other results: "sincerity" beats "Dembski" by a 20-1 margin and "Berlinski" is ko'd by "informed criticism."

Note to the overly sensitive: the contents of this post are not considered to be clever beyond measure. They're just a momentary diversion.
