Jay Richards recently stepped in it when he speculated that, because he didn't find general relativity particularly intuitive,  [therefore Einstein might have been wrong](http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?p=179&amp;more=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1). Now [Sean Carroll calls out Paul Nelson](http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005_06_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#111841959987324102) on [his interpretation](http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?p=432&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1) of a supposedly ID-friendly [essay by cosmologist George Ellis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7043/full/435743a.html). "Nelson," writes Carroll,  "turns Ellis's essay to his advantage via the venerable technique of 'making shit up.'"

Biologists, astronomers, geologists, and now, increasingly, physicists: who's next in line for a Discovery Institute-style "retraining"?
