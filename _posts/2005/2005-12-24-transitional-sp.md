What is the creature on the left?  If you said, "cockroach", give yourself a lump of coal.  But if you said, "termite", give yourself a PEZ dispenser with your favorite cartoon character.  It is in fact a specimen of _Mastotermes darwiniensis_, a large and primitive termite that lives in Australia (they get all the cool critters).  It looks like a roach because termites evolved from roaches, and this particular genus contains primitive members that still resemble their roach cousins in many respects.  On the flip-side, roaches of the wood-eating genus _Cryptocercus_ have many termite-like features, including obligate gut flora and parental care of nymphs.  The termites that we're familiar with -- the little white things that eat houses -- are simply the nymph stage of an otherwise roach-like insect, and _Cryptocercus_ nymphs look an awful lot like termites themselves.  

A biologist going by the name of "Mr. Darwin" has a [great post](http://darwinblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/transitional-species-in-insect_24.html) up about the evolution of termites from roaches, and the various lines of morphological, molecular, and fossil evidence we have.  And there is a cool picture of cute little _Cryptocercus_ nymphs feeding from their mommy's anal secretions.
