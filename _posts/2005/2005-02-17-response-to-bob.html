Bobby Maddex, senior editor of Crux magazine, has <a href="http://cruxmag.typepad.com/sci_phi/2005/02/pandas_thumb.html">replied</a> to <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000801.html">my criticism</a> of inaccuracies that were present in accounts of the Sternberg/Smithsonian situation written by him and by John Coleman. While Coleman responding reasonably and graciously, thanking me for pointing out the inaccuracies and making the requisite corrections, Maddex chooses instead to complain, without justification, about his mistreatment. Along the way, he also adds a few more inaccurate statements to the ones initially criticized. For a full fisking of his reply, see <a href="http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/02/response_to_bob.php">this post</a> at Dispatches from the Culture Wars.
