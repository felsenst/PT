Jerry Coyne has a nice, long, thorough [analysis of ID](http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050822&amp;s=coyne082205&amp;c=1) in The New Republic.  Not much new for the initiated, but a very good primer for newbies to the issue, touching everything from science (or lack thereof) to the religious roots of ID. (I am not sure, but it may require free registration to read)
Did I say it's long?  It's long.
