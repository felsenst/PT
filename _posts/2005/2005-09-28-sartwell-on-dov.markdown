<p>Today's <I>Los Angeles Times</I> features <a href=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-sartwell28sep28,0,7461127.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions>this op-ed</a> by Crispin Sartwell, a political science professor at Dickinson College.  His children attend the Dover area public schools.</p>  

<p>Most of the essay is excellent.  Sartwell argues that ID has no merit as a scientific theory and that it should be taught in science classes as a historical curiosity, like alchemy or astrology.</p>  

<p>But in the last paragraph he turns around and ends up supporting the School Board mandated statement in support of ID.  Very weird.  I present a full analysis in <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/sartwell-on-dover.html>this post</a> over at <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</a>.</p>
