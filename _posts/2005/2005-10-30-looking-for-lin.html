<p>The next <a href="http://tangledbank.net/" title="The Tangled Bank">Tangled Bank</a> is coming up on 2 November 2005, at <a href="http://drcharles.blogspot.com/">The Examining Room of Dr. Charles</a>. Get your links sent in to <a href="mailto:doctorcharles@gmail.com">Dr Charles</a>, <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">PZ Myers</a>, or <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a> by Tuesday.</p>

<p>Also, darn it, I had a few new volunteer hosts to schedule, and I lost some email. Remind me if you were hoping to host in December or January, and heck, if anyone is interested in hosting it anytime, <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">let me know</a>.</p>
