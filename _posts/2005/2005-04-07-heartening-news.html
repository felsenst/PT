<p>Covering the creationism beat is usually an unhappy job, consisting of report after report of yet more stupidity bubbling up. There is hope, though. A Fellow of the Discovery Institute, <a href="http://www.iscid.org/paul-nelson.php">Paul Nelson</a>, paid a <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/paul_nelson_is_visiting_umm/">visit</a> to my university (the <a href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Morris</a>) last night to lecture us on problems in macroevolution and the promise of Intelligent Design creationism in explaining them. He  had a large crowd show up, and the wonderful thing is how <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/i_love_our_students/">UMM students responded</a>. They didn't sit back passively, they didn't throw rotten fruit&hellip;they <i>hammered</i> him with solid, critical questions. The Q&amp;A session went on longer than the talk itself, and with only one exception, the questions and comments were all smart and uniformly anti-pseudoscience.</p>

<p>That is how it is done. That's how we win this battle&mdash;with a well-prepared and intelligent generation of students who can recognize BS when they hear it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11px;">(PLUG: Looking for a good liberal arts university? Prefer a school in the public system because it's less expensive? Want a place with access to the resources of a major research university system, but the student/teacher ratios of a small town college? Take a look at the <a href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Morris</a>. Plus, our students are brilliant.)</p>
