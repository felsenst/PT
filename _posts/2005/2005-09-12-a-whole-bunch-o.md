A short while ago, the Panda's Thumb logged its one millionth visit on the Sitemeter scale. Now, given the somewhat arbitrary measures of what constitutes a "visit" as opposed to a "page hit", one million of these is a fuzzier concept than might be imagined. Call it a pseudo-quantity. 

But what does matter is that we're reaching a sizable community, and helping inform people concerning the ongoing threat to science education posed by antievolutionists of various stripes. We want to thank those of you who visit here who will now consider getting involved in the real work of protecting and enhancing good science education. We'll continue to do our best to keep you informed, and sometimes amused.

Special bonus: [NCSE's 600th Steve joined Project Steve](http://www2.antievolution.org/cs/node/79) within minutes of PT getting its millionth visit.
