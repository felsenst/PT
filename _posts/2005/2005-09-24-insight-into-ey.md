A recent article has filled another gap in our ignorance (and created two new gaps) about eye evolution. As reported in

> How complex and physiologically remarkable structures such as the human eye could evolve has long been a question that has puzzled biologists. But in research reported this week in Current Biology, the evolutionary history of a critical eye protein has revealed a previously unrecognized link between certain components of sophisticated vertebrate eyes - like those found in humans - and those of the primitive light-sensing systems of invertebrates. The findings, from [researchers](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~zool0615/SebShimeld.htm) at the University of Oxford, the University of London and Radboud University in The Netherlands, put in place a conceptual framework for understanding how the vertebrate eye, as we know it, has emerged over evolutionary time.

Urochordate Î²Î³-Crystallin and the Evolutionary Origin of the Vertebrate Eye Lens Sebastian M. Shimeld, Andrew G. Purkiss, Ron P.H. Dirks, Orval A. Bateman, Christine Slingsby, and Nicolette H. Lubsen

> **Abstract**:A refracting lens is a key component of our image-forming camera eye; however, its evolutionary origin is unknown because precursor structures appear absent in nonvertebrates \[1\]. The vertebrate Î²Î³-crystallin genes encode abundant structural proteins critical for the function of the lens \[2\]. We show that the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, which split from the vertebrate lineage before the evolution of the lens, has a single gene coding for a single domain monomeric Î²Î³-crystallin. The crystal structure of Ciona Î²Î³-crystallin is very similar to that of a vertebrate Î²Î³-crystallin domain, except for paired, occupied calcium binding sites. The Ciona Î²Î³-crystallin is only expressed in the palps and in the otolith, the pigmented sister cell of the light-sensing ocellus. The Ciona Î²Î³-crystallin promoter region targeted expression to the visual system, including lens, in transgenic Xenopus tadpoles. We conclude that the vertebrate Î²Î³-crystallins evolved from a single domain protein already expressed in the neuroectoderm of the prevertebrate ancestor. The conservation of the regulatory hierarchy controlling Î²Î³-crystallin expression between organisms with and without a lens shows that the evolutionary origin of the lens was based on co-option of pre-existing regulatory circuits controlling the expression of a key structural gene in a primitive light-sensing system.
