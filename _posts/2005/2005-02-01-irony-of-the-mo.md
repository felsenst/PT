From the Thomas More Law Center, which is defending Dover, PA's inclusion of intelligent design in biology class:

> According to Richard Thompson, President and Chief Counsel for the Law Center, "It's a common tactic for the ACLU to pile-on plaintiffs to give the impression that more people support their position than actually do.  In this case, a recent poll of Dover residents shows that a majority support the school district."
