As reported by [Red State Rabble](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2005/06/its-zoo-in-tulsa.html), [the Tulsa Zoo](http://www.tulsazoo.org/) has approved [a new exhibit](http://www.kotv.com/main/home/stories.asp?whichpage=1&amp;amp;id=84592).  This exhibit will chronicle the biblical account of creation.

The new exhibit was promoted by architect Dan Hicks, who some may recall was involved in the Tulsa Zoo ["removing" evolution displays](http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/zoolies.htm) in the late nineties.  (He also doesn't like [gays at the zoo](http://www.1170kfaq.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=5&amp;amp;num=1180).)

According to the [Tulsa Beacon](http://www.tulsabeacon.com/1.htm), Dan Hicks has pushed for a display on biblical creation because other idols, like Ganesha, are displayed at the zoo.

> Hicks said his display, a series of photographs by Oregon photographer Rick Ergenbright from his book, The Art of God, should be presented because of the numerous displays of pagan religions throughout the zoo. Either put them all up or take them all down, Hicks said.
