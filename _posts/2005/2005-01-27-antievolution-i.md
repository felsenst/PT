Today, Representative Ben Bridges of the Georgia House, introduced a bill, HB 179, that would require evidence against evolution be taught in Georgia's public schools whenever evidence for evolution is taught.  (However, his fairness is a one-way street.)

Word has it that the Republican leadership will not support the bill, which ensures it will have a short life.

The news is fresh, but it should be covered by the evening news and tomorrows papers.  The only story on it so far is [a short one](http://www.accessnorthga.com/news/hall/newfullstory.asp?ID=88634).

I've gotten a hold of the meat of the bill and addressed it on my blog, [De Rerum Natura](http://www.dererumnatura.us/).
