> Our Intelligent Designer,
> Who art in the unspecified-good-place,
> Unknown be Thy name.
> Thy flagella spin, Thy mousetraps snap,
> On Earth, as it is in the
> Unspecified-good-place.
> Give us each day our unchecked apologetic.
> And forgive us our invidious comparisons,
> As we smite those iniquitous Darwinists
> With rhetoric.
> And lead us not into encounters with people
> Who ask us to state our theory,
> But deliver us from biologists
> Who know what we're up to.
> For Thine is the irreducible complexity,
> And the wiggly parts of bacterial bottoms,
> And the inapplicable theorems,
> Now and forever.
> 
> Amen.
