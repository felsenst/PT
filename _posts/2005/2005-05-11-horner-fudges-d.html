<p>Some of you may have heard <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4647581">this story on NPR</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Advertisers are finding new and creative ways to sell their films. Sometimes a movie will be mentioned in the middle of a sitcom, or a star of a film will narrate a documentary, which is paid for by the studio. <b>One studio has even manipulated a scientific discovery to coincide with the opening of a film.</b> A look at some of the tactics studios use to seduce moviegoers to their films.</p></blockquote>

<p>Specifically, the manipulated discovery was by Jack Horner, who fudged the date of discovery of a <i>T. rex</i> fossil to better accommodate the release date of a <i>Jurassic Park</i> movie. My jaw dropped at that news&mdash;that is thoroughly deplorable, and as far as I'm concerned, does serious damage to Horner's reputation, as well as making life more difficult for more ethical scientists.</p>

<p>I'm spared a reason to work up a good rant, though, since you can find a good, thoughtful dissection of the issues at <a href="http://doctorfreeride.blogspot.com/2005/05/communicating-science-to-public-more.html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</a> (which seems to be a very fine place to consider the subject of the title, by the way).</p>
