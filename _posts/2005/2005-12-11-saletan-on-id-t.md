William Saletan of [_Slate_](http://www.slate.com/) writes occasionally about ID, and usually has some good insights.  Here's his latest:

[Fantasy Island](http://www.slate.com/id/2131663/)

The money shot:

> This, more than monkey ancestors, is what alarms creationists. Larson lists the social ills they blame on the teaching of evolution: abortion, eugenics, homosexuality, effeminacy, divorce, communism, long hair. He's been told that Phillip Johnson, the founder of the intelligent design movement, brought up cross-dressing three times in his most recent book. "And those are important issues," Larson adds, trying to sound even-handed, but the journalists laugh. "It is important," a colleague next to me whispers. "There's a lot of shopping involved. You have to buy for two."

Cross-dressing?  I was taught all those other things in my homo-abortion evolution classes, including the fact that evolution leads inexorably to both [socialism and laissez-faire capitalism at the same time](http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/hunch/IDnotes.html#11), but I was never taught how to cross-dress.  How could my home state of South Carolina ever have received an ["A"](/archives/2005/12/report-card-sor.html) while leaving out the cross-dressing? 

Anyway, this is the fourth article that Saletan has written on ID in the last few years.  Here are the earlier ones in chronological order:

[Unintelligible Redesign](http://www.slate.com/id/2062009/)

[What Matters in Kansas](http://www.slate.com/id/2118320/)

[Grow Some Testables](http://www.slate.com/id/2127052/)

I didn't care much for the second one, but he makes up for it with the third one.
