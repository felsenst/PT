My current research focuses on [_Streptococcus agalactiae_](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/msds-ftss/msds145e.html) (group B streptococcus, GBS), a bacterium that is the leading cause of neonatal meningitis in the United States. It also is a leading cause of invasive infection in the elderly, and can cause sepsis and toxic shock-like syndrome in healthy adults. No vaccine is currently available.

But what's garnered attention recently hasn't been any clinical presentations or new case reports of GBS disease; it's the bacterium's DNA. Specifically, the whole genomic sequences of 8 different strains of GBS, and the conclusions the authors have come to regarding bacterial genetic diversity--that it may be "endless."
