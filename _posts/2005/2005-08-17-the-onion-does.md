Not quite as good as some of their classics, but their article on [intelligent falling  ](http://www.theonion.com/news/index.php?issue=4133&amp;n=2) provides a few chuckles.

> "Anti-falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the 'electromagnetic force,' the 'weak nuclear force,' the 'strong nuclear force,' and so-called 'force of gravity,'" Burdett said. "And they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force. But readers of the Bible have already known for millennia what this one, unified force is: His name is Jesus."
