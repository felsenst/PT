<p><i>Nature</i> has an editorial and a news item on Bush's Intelligent Design creationism flap. The striking thing about both of them is how incredibly optimistic they are, although they also emphasize that while the response by the scientific community has been vigorous, it has to continue to be strong and outspoken. I agree with this idea, too, although I regret to say that it would be personally impossible for me to do the political part (can you guess why?):</p>

<blockquote><p>Many experts say that scientists should get more involved in local politics&mdash;especially on school boards, where the conflicting views of scientists and advocates of intelligent design often play out. "Scientists have to be evangelical about explaining what science is, as well as its limitations," says Krauss.<p></blockquote>

<p>I've put the complete text of both articles on <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/nature_gets_in_the_act/">Pharyngula</a>. They are well worth reading. They cheered me up, at least.</p>
