Calling all Iowans...I'm working on getting a Citizens for Science group up and running in the state.  At this point in the game, I have a group of about 20 people from around the state (mostly Iowa City/Cedar Rapids, Des Moines/Ames, and Cedar Falls) who are interested, and we're still very early in the planning stages.  We're looking for people who are interested in participation at any level.  Drop me an [email](mailto:tara@pandasthumb.org) if you're interested!
