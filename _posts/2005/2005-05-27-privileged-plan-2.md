> It's rather like a puddle waking up one morning— I know they don't normally do this, but allow me, I'm a science fiction writer— A puddle wakes up one morning and thinks: "This is a very interesting world I find myself in. It fits me very neatly. In fact it fits me so neatly... I mean really precise isn't it?... It must have been made to have me in it." And the sun rises, and it's continuing to narrate this story about how this hole must have been made to have him in it. And as the sun rises, and gradually the puddle is shrinking and shrinking and shrinking— and by the time the puddle ceases to exist, it's still thinking— it's still trapped in this idea that— that the hole was there for it. And if we think that the world is here for us we will continue to destroy it in the way that we have been destroying it, because we think that we can do no harm.

> Hector Avalos, associate professor of religious studies, has debated the validity of creationism, the existence of God and Jesus' resurrection, among other topics, while at Iowa State. He said Gonzalez's work attempts to portray "a dressed-up version of Christian theology" as science.
> Patterson, who has written a review of the book and will present a scientific critique of it and intelligent design on Thursday, said he enjoyed "The Privileged Planet."
> 
> "The book is rich with good science in it," he said.

> But, he said, the intentions of many intelligent design theorists were clear.

> "It is a religious apologetic disguised as science," he said

> Readers, do something about this. Please send an e-mail to giving@si.edu addressed to Mr. Randall Kremer, Public Affairs. Tell him of your concern over this situation. And, you might add that the JREF is willing to donate $20,000 to the Smithsonian Institution if they agree to give back the "Discovery Institute" $16,000 and decline to sponsor the showing of the film. And the JREF will not require the Smithsonian to run any films or propaganda that favor our point of view...
