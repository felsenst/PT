Today's _Salon.com_ has a good cover story by Michelle Goldberg focusing primarily on the Dover controversy, but also commenting on the general upsurge of neo-creationism around the country these days.  Our own Nick Matzke gets quoted a few times:  [The New Monkey Trial](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/01/10/evolution/index.html).  (If you're not a member, you can watch a short ad to see the article for free.) 

_Salon_ is a left-leaning rag, so the article focuses a lot on the political aspect of the "controversy", particularly the machinations of the Religious Right and their self-declared mandate.  For a different political angle, see [Origin of the Specious](http://reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml), an older article from _Reason_, which is one of my all-time favorites.  It looks at anti-evolution as an ideological imperative for Neoconservative movement.  Short answer:  Neoconservatives aren't religious, but think it's important that everyone is.  After reading these articles, try not to drive or operate heavy machinery.
