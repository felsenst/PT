Since PZ is apparently too shy to suggest this himself, I will do so on the chance that there's a smidge of non-overlapping readership between here and Pharyngula.  Those who have not yet done so, go to [Pharyngula](http://pharyngula.org/) and read [**this essay**](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/the_proper_reverence_due_those_who_have_gone_before/).  It's also on [The American Street](http://www.reachm.com/amstreet/archives/2005/04/10/the-proper-reverence-due-those-who-have-gone-before/).  It's a keeper.
