<p>A reader sent me a link to this <a href="http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=99568">horrid anti-evolution guest column</a> in the MetroWest Daily News (I presume this is a suburban branch of the Boston Herald). It's appallingly bad, but so typical of the creationist strategy: fast and furious falsehood flinging, and the presumption no one will have the initiative or the ability to crosscheck the claims. It's also all stated in a pompous, self-satisfied style, as if the author knows more about biology than all those biologists out there&hellip;yet as becomes quickly obvious, the man knows <i>nothing</i> about genetics.</p>

<p>Well, I know a little about biology and genetics, and I'm willing to rip his dishonest essay apart, and there's always <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html">Mark Isaak's Index to Creationist Claims</a>, which is a wonderful resource that makes it easy to tear into articles like this. It always surprises me, though, how unimaginative creationists are&mdash;it's always the same old bogus nonsense, repeated over and over again, with such oblivious confidence. Everything in Marty Pomeroy's essay has already been refuted.</p>
