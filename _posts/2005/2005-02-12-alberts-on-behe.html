<p>Behe's op-ed piece in the NY Times of 7 February, which was <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000796.html">rebuked</a> <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/behe_jumps_the_shark/">here</a> earlier, has been given an even more stinging setback. One of the authorities Behe cited, Bruce Alberts, has also come out in the pages of the NY Times with a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/12/opinion/l12science.html?partner=rssuserland">forceful response</a>.

<p>The pro-science side of the blogosphere responds with fierce glee, with comments at <a href="http://lloydletta.blogspot.com/2005/02/intelligent-design-creationist-michael.html">Lloydletta's Nooz and Comments</a>, <a href="http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/alberts-on-behe.html">EvolutionBlog</a>, and 
<a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/aww_what_a_nice_darwins_day_presenthellip/">Pharyngula</a>. It's the perfect fillip for our Darwin's Day celebrations.</p>
<hr /><p><a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/02/12/metaphor_metaphor.php">Carl Zimmer</a> also weighs in.</p>
