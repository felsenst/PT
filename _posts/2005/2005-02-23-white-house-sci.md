From our friends at the [NCSE](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/US/768_white_house_science_advisor__2_22_2005.asp)

>  Chris Mooney reports in The American Prospect that John H. Marburger III, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, denounced "intelligent design" as unscientific. Mooney writes:
> 
> Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, Marburger fielded an audience question about "Intelligent Design" (ID), the latest supposedly scientific alternative to Charles Darwin's theory of descent with modification. The White House's chief scientist stated point blank, "Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory." And that's not all -- as if to ram the point home, Marburger soon continued, "I don't regard Intelligent Design as a scientific topic."
> 
> In March 2004, when asked about the Bush administration's scientific credibility in light of the president's reported skepticism about evolution, Marburger similarly got it right: ["Evolution is a cornerstone of modern biology."](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2004/US/187_white_house_science_advisorb_3_5_2004.asp)
