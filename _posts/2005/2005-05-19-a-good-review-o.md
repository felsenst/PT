I have not had time yet to reflect in writing on the Kansas hearings, but [**here**](http://www.alternet.org/story/22042/) is one of the best stories I've seen on what actually went on in the hearings.  About the author, it says

> Stan Cox lives in Salina, Kan. He has a Ph.D. in plant breeding and cytogenetics and has been a plant breeder for 22 years.

I encourage anyone interested in the Kansas hearings to read this article.  If you think it is appropriate, you might send him an email at t.stan@cox.net or offer a comment at the alternet site.
