I ran across this cool blog, <i><a href="http://brightline.typepad.com/law_evolution_science_and/">Law, Evolution, and Junk Science. </a></i> I thought the <a href="http://brightline.typepad.com/law_evolution_science_and/frequently_asked_questions/index.html">FAQ</a> put it very well:<blockquote><b>Intelligent Design is a paradigm of junk science and abuse of the legal system, both in court, at the local school board level...and at state and federal [legislative] and executive branches of government. Furthermore, Intelligent Design, and its Scientific Creationism parent, have both been spearheaded by lawyers, from William Jennings Bryan in the 1920s, through Wendell Bird in the 1970s , to Phillip E. Johnson, today. To rebut the spurious claims of these fellow members of the bar, a very large number of scientists have had to take time from productive research to deal with the issue. I feel the obligation to undo the damage these lawyers have done.</b></blockquote>

Hear, hear!
