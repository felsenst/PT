During the cross examination of Michael Behe in the Dover trial, he was questioned about whether the peer review process for his book, _Darwin's Black Box_, was as rigorous as for a scholarly article in a refereed journal. He replied that it was even more rigorous. That led to an exchange that seriously impeached the credibility of Behe's testimony. I have one report on it [here](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/10/id_books_and_peer_review.php) and John Lynch has another report on it [here](http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=564).
