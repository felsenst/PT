<img src="http://komodo.procombel.be/images/dragon.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" /> Carl Zimmer has a post today about [the work of Dr. Bryan Grieg Fry](http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/11/21/which_came_first_the_snake_or_the_venom.php) on the evolution of snake venom.  If that name sounds familiar to those of you who aren't reptile specialists, you may have run across Dr. Fry's [homepage](http://www.venomdoc.com/), or you may have seen his research profiled previously on Panda's Thumb [here](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000946.html), or you may have read comments by the good doc [in this thread.](/archives/2005/11/in-the-its-so-s.html#comment-54890)  Zimmer, as always, has an excellent overview of Fry _et al_'s new paper in Nature ([link ](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature04328.html)), but he didn't emphasize the one sneak peek I received from Bryan.  So, I thought I'd add a bit to Carl's overview.
