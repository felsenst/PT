Remember growing up and playing pretend games as a child? Remember the geeky kid who would invent excuses as to why no negative consequence would ever touch him? "I had the super-special armor coat on" or "I had levitator shoes and you didn't notice." Yeah, you remember.

Ever wonder what sort of job awaited him in the grown-up world? Well, now he's [writing prose for the Discovery Institute](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-28-2005/0004133680&amp;EDATE=). Here's a bit from the press release:

> Building on the mischaracterizations of the first day's witness, the ACLU continued to put an imposter version of intelligent design on trial in the second day of the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial.
> 
> "I know what intelligent design is, and it sure isn't what they're talking about in Harrisburg," said Casey Luskin, the program officer for public policy and legal affairs for Discovery Institute. Discovery Institute is the nation's leading think-tank researching intelligent design.

We've wondered how the DI would take ID going down the tubes, and now we know: it's full-blown hallucinatory denial of the bleeding obvious. Eddie Haskell would be proud.
