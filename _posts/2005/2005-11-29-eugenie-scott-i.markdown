<p>For readers in Virginia, let me mention that NCSE Executive Director Eugenie Scott will be giving two talks this week in our neck of the woods.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, November 30 she will be at Oakton High School, 2900 Sutton Road, Vienna, VA, from 7:00-9:00 PM.  More information can be obtained by writing to info@allianceforscience.org.</p>

<p>On Thursday, December 1 she will be speaking at the Fairfax campus of George Mason University, again at 7:00 PM, in the Johnson Center- Dewberry Hall South.  Driving directions and parking information is available <a href=http://www.gmu.edu/welcome/Directions-to-GMU.html>here</a>.</p>

<p>Scott's full speaking schedule is available <a href=http://www.natcenscied.org/meeting.asp>here</a>.</p>

<p>I will be attending Wednesday's event.  Sadly, a prior engagement will keep me away on Thursday.</p>
