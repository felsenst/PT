See blog attention from [Thoughts From Kansas](http://jgrr.blogspot.com/2005/06/must-read-books.html), [Pharyngula](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/the_republican_war_on_science/), [Science And Politics](http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/2005/06/buy-this-book-now.html) (Helpful tip: "Buying thrillers written by the [other Chris Mooney](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Chris%20Mooney/102-5833660-0818533) is not going to help the cause...."), [Stranger Fruit](http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=364), [TPM Cafe](http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/8/3/19543/88363), and [others](http://www.chriscmooney.com/article_db.asp?id=315).

An adaptation of his chapter "**Creation Science 2.0**" is now up at [_American Prospect Online_](http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=10084).  It is entitled "[Inferior Design](http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=10084)."  In my [previous post](/archives/2005/08/chris-mooney-th.html) I quoted Mooney's setup for his chapter, which describes what happened to "two talented young political thinkers," liberal Republicans at Harvard who made the case for reforming Republicanism in the 1966 _The Party That Lost Its Head_.

In "[Inferior Design](http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=10084)," Mooney gives the punchline:

> Their critique was both prescient and poignant. But the authors -- Bruce Chapman and George Gilder -- have since bitten their tongues and morphed from liberal Republicans into staunch conservatives. Once opponents of right-wing anti-intellectualism, they are now prominent supporters of conservative attacks on the theory of evolution, not just a bedrock of modern science but also one of the greatest intellectual achievements of human history. Chapman now serves as president of the Discovery Institute; Gilder is a senior fellow there.
> 
> So not only have Chapman and Gilder become everything they once criticized; their transformation highlights how the GOP went in precisely the opposite direction from the one that these young authors once prescribed -- which is why the anti-intellectual disposition they so aptly diagnosed in 1966 still persists among modern conservatives, helping to fuel a full-ï¬‚edged crisis today over the politicization of science and expertise.
