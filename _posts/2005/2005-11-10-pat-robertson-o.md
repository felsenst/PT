If the Dover situation was a joke, [this](http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=19453) would be the punchline. Pat Robertson says that by voting out the pro-ID school board, the people of Dover have lost their protection from God:

> "I'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover. If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God, you just rejected Him from your city. And don't wonder why He hasn't helped you when problems begin, if they begin. I'm not saying they will, but if they do, just remember, you just voted God out of your city. And if that's the case, don't ask for His help because he might not be there."

Gee Pat, does that mean you won't be there to try and pray away a hurricane like you pretended to do in Virginia? What a despicable cretin. Maybe you could call for the assassination of the new Dover school board president. But remember....ID is not religious at all, it has nothing to do with Christianity or the religious right's agenda, nothing whatsoevr. It's just pure science from the word go. \*eyeroll\*
