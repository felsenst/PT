As a virtual bar, the Panda's Thumb relies on passing packets to enable the contributors to say their stuff and the commenters to put in their two cents. Well, for various reasons the management hasn't been completely happy with the current packet-passer, and has arranged for a new packet-passing service. Unfortunately, this means that in the switchover, there may be a longish period where the name and the particular address used aren't matched up. We have to change the "domain name service" (thanks, "wbrameld4")  entries for PT tonight, and these may take up to 48 hours to propagate. So don't be surprised if you can't get to PT this weekend. We hope that it won't take that long for the DNS entries to propagate, but here we'll give you fair warning.
