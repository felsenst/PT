Over at his <a href="http://www.designinference.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, Bill Dembski had published the front matter [<a href="http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.04.Johnson_Festschrift.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>] for <em>A Man For This Season: The Phillip Johnson Celebration Volume</em> to be published by InterVarsity Press in 2006, and edited by Dembski and Jed Macosko. The volume is a <em>festscrift</em> for PEJ that stems from the celebration that was held at the opening of the <em>Intelligent Design and the Future of Science</em> conference that was held in Biola in April 2004. This is the conference, you will remember, that PEJ received the first <em>Phillip E. Johnson Award for Liberty and Truth</em> "honoring lifetime achievements of an individual who has expanded the scope of academic freedom and truth-seeking." 

<p>Dembski is known to all, Jed Macosko perhaps not so. Macosko holds the PhD in chemistry from UC Berkeley, and in his portion of the introduction he recounts living in Johnson's basement for a period while in grad school. He is an ISCID <a href="http://www.iscid.org/fellows.php" target="_blank">fellow</a>, and was a DI/CSC fellow between 2001 and 2003. He is <a href="http://www.wfu.edu/~macoskjc/index.htm" target="_blank">currently</a> an assistant professor (of biophysics) at Wake Forest University. Unlike most ID supporters, he seems to actually publish peer-reviewed scientific research, though none of it appears to offer a theory of intelligent design or any explicit discussion of design.

<p>Over at <a href="http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=304">Stranger Fruit</a>, I offer some thoughts on the volume and its constituent papers. This is - obviously - not a review as I have not read the book and I will no doubt comment more when I do so next year.
