[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution](http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/cobb/0505/24a1evolution.html) is reporting today that efforts are now under way in Cobb County, GA to remove the evolution disclaimers placed on science textbooks.

The county is still appealing, and if they manage to eventually win, we may see the disclaimers placed back on textbooks.
