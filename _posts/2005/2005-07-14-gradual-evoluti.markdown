If you will indulge a bit of self-promotion, my <a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/actualism.html>new column</a> for CSICOP's <a href=http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/>Creation Watch</a> website is now available.  In it I offer some thoughts on why gradual evolution is a more plausible explanation than ID for the existence of complex biological systems.  Enjoy!
