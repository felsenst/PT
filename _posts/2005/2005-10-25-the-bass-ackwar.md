['New recruits' said needed for intelligent design](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9805776/)

In the Dover circus (updates continue [here](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/09/waterloo_in_dov.html)), a sociologist named Steve Fuller testified yesterday on behalf of the defense. What was a theme of his testimony? Recruit the younger generation to give ID theory a boost--since apparently, the senior level ID "theorists" haven't been able to come up with jack squat.


> Introducing "intelligent design" to high school students could help the idea gain wider acceptance among mainstream scientists, a sociology professor testified Monday in a landmark federal trial over whether the concept can be mentioned in public school biology classes.
> 
> Fuller said minority views can sometimes have a difficult time getting a toehold in the scientific community, but students might be inspired to develop intelligent design as future scientists if they hear about the concept in school.
> 
> "You have to provide openings where you have new recruits to the theory," Fuller said. "Unless you put it into the school system, it's not going to happen spontaneously."

And later in the article:

> "It seems to me in many respects the cards are stacked against radical, innovative views getting a fair hearing in science these days," he said.

  
Once again, it makes you wonder how such "minority views" as [a bacterial cause for ulcers](http://aetiology.blogspot.com/2005/10/marshall-and-warren-win-prize-for-work.html) and [symbiogenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis) ever made it without a political lobby.  

Edited to add:  once again, [Mike Argento nails it.](http://ydr.com/story/doverbiology/91282/)  

>  Fuller said intelligent design is, essentially, a half-baked idea, pretty much something the intelligent design guys have whipped up without doing much in the way of producing evidence.
> 
> And that's why it should be taught to ninth-graders in Dover.
> 
> You know, I can come up with a lot of half-baked ideas that no one in their right mind would want to teach to kids in Dover. Let's see. How about this? Cows think in Spanish. Discuss.
