<p>On December 1st and 2nd, there will be a <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/lectures/2005_summaries.html">series of four lectures by Sean Carroll and David Kingsley</a> offered by the <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/lectures/">HHMI</a>. Even if you aren't in a fabulously well-connected East coast city, though, you'll be able to watch it&mdash;it's going to be <a href='http://www.hhmi.org/lectures/webcast_test.html'>webcast</a> (via Real, which is unfortunate&hellip;I don't care for them much).</p><p>It should be excellent!</p>
