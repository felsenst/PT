An interesting story by Laurie Goodstein ran in the New York Times on the [multi-year search of the Thomas More Law Center](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/04/science/sciencespecial2/04design.html?ex=1131339600&amp;en=e41600f2994a2c55&amp;ei=5070) to find an "intelligent design" case. Having formed in 1999, they approached their first case candidate in 2000. And, of course, that search went on in the following years, until TMLC hooked up with the Dover Area School District in 2004.
