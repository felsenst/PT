<p>Scoot on over to <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/">The Loom</a> for the latest details on the <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/03/03/the_hobbits_brain.php">brain of <i>Homo floresiensis</i></a>. The results from a detailed CT-scan of the skull of the fossil hominid are in, and they are very interesting. The short answer: the brain of the hobbit most closely resembles that of <i>Homo erectus</i> and does not look like the brain of a microcephalic, but it does have its own peculiarities. Read <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/03/03/the_hobbits_brain.php">Carl's story</a> for all of the details.</p>
