Apparently, the Intelligent Design Network and their friends running the Kansas State Board of Education have had absolutely no luck recruiting real scientists to participate in the Antievolution show-trial they have planned for May.  Major kudos to [Kansas Citizens for Science](http://www.kcfs.org), their efforts are now getting noticed internationally as well as nationally.  

I have written a [more thorough summary](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/KS/128_biologists_snub_39kangaroo__3_30_2005.asp) of recent events in [this NCSE update](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/KS/128_biologists_snub_39kangaroo__3_30_2005.asp).  You can freely subscribe (with [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) or something similar) to a [news feed for NCSE updates](http://www.ncseweb.org/rss/ncseweb.xml); a [weekly email update](http://www.ncseweb.org/ncse_news_list.asp) is also available.

The blogs [Thoughts from Kansas](http://jgrr.blogspot.com/) and [Red State Rabble](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/), [Les Lane's website](http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/creatks.html), and the [Kansas Citizens for Science website](http://www.kcfs.org) and [discussion forums](http://www.kcfs.org/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi) are the places to go to get the latest on Kansas.
