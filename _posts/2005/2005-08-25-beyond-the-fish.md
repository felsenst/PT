More and more people, scientists and religious people alike, are coming to the obvious conclusion that Intelligent Design is scientifically vacuous.

[Beyond the fish wars](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/08/25/EDG6MECISQ1.DTL)

In the San Francisco Chronicle, Jim Burklo, a minister of Sausalito Presbyterian Church, presents his opinion

>  It \[Intelligent Design\] is not a theoretical alternative to evolution, because it suggests no other credible means by which this outside intelligence created the complexity of life. There is nothing in the theory of evolution, the only one that holds any water in explaining the origin of the species, that proves or disproves the existence of such an intelligent "designer." Even if one thinks of God as a separate, distinct being that manipulates the universe, "intelligent design" offers no intelligent reason to suggest that evolution wasn't God's chosen instrument of creation.

In addition Intelligent Design is considered by many to be religiously dangerous as it hides the Designer (wink wink) in the shadows of our ignorance rather than in what we know

> This "awe-wareness" gives spiritual expression its rightful place alongside scientific exploration. We don't need the non-theory of "intelligent design" to make the claim that science and religion are compatible. God is manifested dramatically in the processes of nature that science relentlessly strives to understand and describe.
