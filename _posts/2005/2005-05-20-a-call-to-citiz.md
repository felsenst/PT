I am working on a joint statement from Citizens for Science groups about "intelligent design" creationism influencing education.  I already have several groups on board but am wondering if there are any I've missed.  If you are a member of a Citizens for Science organization, either local, state, national, or international please <a href="mailto:QVQ00GEk4Ew:1F8771oM3ol17FJMH0ML20w65oZS2VoR4lw;7JML0ZM97JQL0YAE2Uk;3EN05k931lIJ4EU82lc+">email me</a> the contact information and background of your organization.

Don't forget to spread the word.
