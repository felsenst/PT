<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2006/2005-12-05_Talbot_New_Yorker_Darwin_in_the_Dock_Fig1_p198.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />I have posted a [bunch of new material](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/) on the NCSE _Kitzmiller v. Dover_ website.  Almost all of the post-trial filings, responses, etc., are now online in the [post-trial directory](http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/index.php?path=all_legal%2Fpost-trial/) or the [amicus directory](http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/index.php?path=all_legal%2Famicus/).  The shortest and sweetest filing is probably the [Plaintiffs' Response to the _amicus_ briefs](http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/amicus/2005-12-07_Plaintiffs_response_to_FTE-DI_amicus.pdf) (PDF) of the Discovery Institute and the Foundation for Thought and Ethics.  I quote the good bits [here](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=90).

Also, on the [NCSE front page](http://www.ncseweb.org/) there is [a summary of Margaret Talbot's excellent long review](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/PA/793_new_yorker_on_kitzmiller_case_12_12_2005.asp) of the trial published in last week's _New Yorker_.  The drawing at left is the preview graphic for the full-page drawing that accompanies the print article; it depicts plaintiffs attorney Eric Rothschild cross-examining the star ID witness, Michael Behe.  As the caption put it, Behe was cross-examined "with cheerful mercilessness."  I imagine that one will be going on Eric's door.
