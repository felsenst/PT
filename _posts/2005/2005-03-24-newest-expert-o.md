Everyone's favorite defender of the 10 Commandments, Roy Moore, has spoken out against evolution on MSNBC's ["Hardball."](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7275644/)

Partial transcript:

> MATTHEWS:  But when we create public schools that have to teach science...
> 
> MOORE:  Sure.
> 
> MATTHEWS:  Usually by high school level, teach biology, for example. 
> 
> MOORE:  Sure.
> 
> MATTHEWS:  How do you teach Genesis as true biology, true science?
> 
> MOORE:  I don‘t think you teach Genesis as the science.  You teach the creationism. 
> 
> MATTHEWS:  Well, creationism.  Well, isn‘t that--is that a scientific belief? 
> 
> MOORE:  That is a scientific belief in many opinions, yes. 
> 
> MATTHEWS:  Not opinions, but is it scientific belief?  In other words, if you send someone to medical school, would you want them to study creationism as part of their biology testing and education?
> 
> MOORE:  I would.  I sure would. 
> 
> MATTHEWS:  You would want them to study creationism? 
> 
> MOORE:  Sure.  Sure.
> 
> MATTHEWS:  What value would that have in their training? 
> 
> MOORE:  Because there‘s no--there‘s no scientific evidence of evolution. 
> 
> Evolution is a theory and has been recognized so by many.  You have always heard of the missing link, haven‘t you? 
> 
> MATTHEWS:  Right. 
> 
> MOORE:  It is still missing.  In other words, they can‘t explain how male and female came and every species from one atom or one amoeba.  

The Moore interview is the final one, about 3/4 of the way down the page, and part of NBC's "Faith in America" series this week.
