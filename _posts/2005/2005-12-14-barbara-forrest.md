The [ACLU-PA blog](http://aclupa.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-reward-for-continuing-to-read-our.html) "[Speaking Freely](http://aclupa.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-reward-for-continuing-to-read-our.html)" is reporting that Judge Jones is probably going to hand down his decision next week.  Trust me, those ACLU guys are close to the source.

Over on the [NCSE Kitzmiller website](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/), I have finally gotten a chance to OCR and upload [Barbara Forrest's supplementary expert report](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=94) in the Kitzmiller case.  This document was originally filed under seal, but became public when introduced into evidence in open court.  See the [experts folder](http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/index.php?path=experts/) for all expert reports.

This is important because Forrest's supplemental report was the first analysis of the [_Pandas_ drafts](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/evolution_of_creationism/) and their significance -- which will, I suspect, be large, since the drafts [_prove_ beyond any doubt](/archives/2005/10/i-guess-id-real.html) that "intelligent design" really is just a legal fiction to cover creationism [just like scientists have been saying for 16 years](http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=21), and furthermore it is specifically the very same kind of [vague, evasive creationism that Dean Kenyon tried to sell the Supreme Court in 1986](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/kenyon.html), but that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional anyway in [_Edwards v. Aguillard_](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html).  In other words, the Supreme Court has already decided issue, unless a [mere word switcheroo](/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html) makes a legal difference.  But we shall see next week.

In other news, I have also [posted a few more _amicus_ briefs](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=93) (one which Steve Fuller [does _not_ support!](http://scipolicy.net/amicus-currie/fuller%20dissent.htm)), [TalkOrigins _Kitzmiller_ page](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html) now has an [HTML version of the Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/pf.html), and we have some discussion at [Derivative Work](http://lquilter.net/blog/archives/2005/12/13/a-few-choice-id-quotes) and [from Ed Brayton](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/12/interesting_items_in_dover_bri.php), who by the way is [selling out](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/12/ed_is_selling_out.php).
