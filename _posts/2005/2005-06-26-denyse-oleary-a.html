In <a href="http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/2005/06/hold-revolution-without-me-but-save-me.html" target="_blank">this post</a> Denyse O'Leary "comments" on a session I am organizing and chairing at the forthcoming International Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology meeting. <a href="http://www.ishpssb.org/ocs/viewsessionabstract.php?id=308" target="_blank">The session</a> is the second of a two-parter on the Darwinian Revolution, and specifically deals with the following:
<blockquote>Many faculty members teach “Darwinian Revolution” courses. What do they teach, and how and why? And what difference does the discussion about whether there was such a revolution and what it involved make pedagogically? Should the latest scholarship matter to the teaching, or are there different and overriding pedagogical values?</blockquote>

<p>Over at <a href="http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=415">Stranger Fruit</a> I deal with O'Leary's claims about the nature of the "Darwinian Revolution" and question her knowledge of history and philosophy of science.

<p><b>Update: 21:30</b> - O'Leary has tried to defend herself against my post, so I've replied <a href="http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=416">here</a>
