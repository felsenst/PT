The [Coalition for Science](http://coalitionforscience.org/mt-static/coalition.html) is planning a [series of events](http://coalitionforscience.org/mt-static/events.html) as the Kansas Kangaroo Court on "evidence against evolution" gets going. 

The Coalition for Science is [planning ahead for media participation](http://coalitionforscience.org/newsblog-archives/2005/05/media_arrangeme.html#more). They will have a Media Booth with media information kits and people on hand to answer questions from the media throughout the day, a broadcast media briefing at 3PM each day, and scientists and educators will conduct an analysis of the day's hearings half an hour following the close of hearings each day (with a light meal provided... these folks appear to know their media relations).

Pedro Irigonegaray was asked by the Department of Education to represent the Draft 2 science standards at the hearings, empowered to call science witnesses to testify. In the [newsblog](http://coalitionforscience.org/newsblog-current/index.html) of the Coalition for Science, [Pedro speaks out on the hearings](http://coalitionforscience.org/newsblog-archives/2005/05/news_alert_for.html#more):

> The KSBE subcommittee has made it clear that they do not support Draft 2 of the standards and that they support the non-scientific opinions of the Intelligent Design (ID) Minority. 
> 
> It is our opinion that the intended purpose of these hearings is:
> 
> · to provide the controlling Majority of the KSBE a rationale, in essence a façade of credibility, when they eventually change the standards; and
> 
> · to give the Intelligent Design movement a national forum to present their theological and anti-science ideas disguised as 'science.'
> 
> I have joined thousands of scientists worldwide who recognize these hearings to be no more than a showcase for Intelligent Design, and to be rigged against mainstream science. I support their refusal to participate.
