[Georgia's House Bill 179](http://www.dererumnatura.us/archives/2005/01/full_text_of_hb.html) was tabled by the education committee after hearing comments from the bill's sponsor, a couple of biologists, and some education groups.  Most of the education committee are former educators and didn't like the anti-science content of the bill, its opposition to local control, its unfunded mandate, and the need to buy new textbooks and write a new curriculum to match the bill.

Although many people spoke against the bill, the education committee only asked questions from Rep. Bridges, its lone supporter.  He argued that schools should teach facts not theories.  (Although, that is not in his bill, that is how he describes his bill.  Go figure.)  The education committee questioned him on his (mis)use of scientific terminology and whether he had issues with hypotheses.

See that wasn't hard; was it?
