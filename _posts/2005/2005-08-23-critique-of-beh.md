Last year Ian, Steve, and I wrote [a critique](entry://480) of a flawed anti-"Darwinian processes" paper by Michael Behe and David Snoke.  At the time we had been discussing turning it into a publication, but we set aside the idea after we learned that the editors of _Protein Science_ had asked an expert on gene evolution, [Michael Lynch from Indiana University](http://www.bio.indiana.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/Lynch.html), to write a response to Behe and Snoke (2004).

Now it comes to pass that Michael Lynch's response and a reply by Behe and Snoke is going to be published in next month's _[Protein Science](http://www.proteinscience.org/future/14.9.shtml)_.

We'll keep our readers informed about Lynch's analysis of Behe and Snoke's science.
