The Abstract reads

> On several occasions during the last eighty years, states have attempted  to either prohibit the teaching of evolution in public school science classes or  counter the teaching of evolution with mandatory references to the religious  doctrine of creationism. The Supreme Court struck down examples of the  first two generations of these statutes, holding that they violated the  Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. A third generation of  creationist legislation is now being proposed. Under this new generation of  creationism legislation, science teachers would present so-called "intelligent  design" theory as an alternative to evolution. Intelligent design theory  asserts that a supernatural intelligence intervened in the natural world to  dictate the nature and ordering of all biological species, which do not evolve  from lower-to higher-order beings. This article considers whether these  intelligent design creationism proposals can survive constitutional scrutiny.  The authors analyze the religious, philosophical, and scientific details of  intelligent design theory, and assess these details in light of the constitutional  doctrine developed by the Court in its previous creationism decisions. The  Article discusses several factors that pose problems for intelligent design  theory, including the absence of objective scientific support for intelligent  design, evidence of strong links between intelligent design and religious  doctrine, the use of intelligent design to limit the dissemination of scientific  theories that are perceived as contradicting religious teachings, and the fact  that the irreducible core of intelligent design theory is what the Court has  called the "manifestly religious" concept of a God or Supreme Being. Based  on these details, the authors conclude that intelligent design theory cannot  survive scrutiny under the constitutional framework used by the Court to  invalidate earlier creationism mandates.
