The York Daily Record had [an article](http://ydr.com/story/local/63020/) on Sunday on the possible expert witnesses in the Kitzmiller v. Dover School District case.

Experts for the plaintiffs:


* Brian Alters
* Barbara Forrest
* Ken Miller
* Rob Pennock


Experts for the defendents:


* Michael Behe
* John A. Campbell
* William Dembski
* Scott Minnich
* Warren Nord


I think that the court could make money selling tickets for the trial. They should rent an auditorium and get in touch with Ticketmaster...
