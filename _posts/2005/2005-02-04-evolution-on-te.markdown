I am gathering up transcripts of television segments that deal with evolution, and I need some help.  I watch a truly ludicrous amount of television, and follow the cable news chat shows pretty closely, but I'm sure there are many segments out there that I have missed.  I'd appreciate it greatly if people could provide links to television segments they might have seen in the last few months.

Have any of the morning shows done evolution segments?  How about Hardball?  Or the now defunct Crossfire?  Help!
