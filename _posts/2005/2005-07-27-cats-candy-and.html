<p>Here's a small taste of Roald Dahl's <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141301155/pharyngula-20"><i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i></a>, a sweet story about a poor boy and his visit to an amazing candy factory&hellip;you've probably heard of it, since the new movie is getting a lot of press.</p>

<blockquote><blockcode>Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever get to taste a bit of chocolate. The whole family saved up their money for that special occasion, and when the great day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small chocolate bar to eat all by himself. And each time he received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it, but never to touch it. Then at last, when he could stand it no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and then he would take a tiny nibble&mdash;just enough to allow the lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue. The next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and so on. And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.<img src="http://pharyngula.org/images/tinystop.gif" width="13" height="12" alt="stop" valign="top"></blockcode></blockquote>

<p>That's how it is published, at any rate. What if it read something like this?</p>
