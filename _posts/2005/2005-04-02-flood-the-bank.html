<p><a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/03/one-week-reminder-for-tangled-bank.html">Orac is busy</a> and is having blogger problems, and we're about to make it worse for him: he's hosting the <a href="http://tangledbank.net/" title="The Tangled Bank">Tangled Bank</a> this weekend. Pile on. Send him links to your science stories at &lt;orac_usa AT hotmail DOT com&gt; or to <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a> or to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a>. Please include the words "TANGLED BANK" in the subject line to make life a <i>little</i> easier for him, but otherwise, make him even busier&hellip;and then look for the next edition to appear on Wednesday at <a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/">Respectful Insolence</a>.</p>
