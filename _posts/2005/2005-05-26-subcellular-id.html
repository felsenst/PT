At <a href="http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/2/2005/05/25/id_friendly_journal_paper_makes_testable" target="_blank">The ID Report</a>, Denyse O'Leary (journalist, <a href="http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">post-Darwinist</a>, and fan of the <a href="http://post-darwinist.blogspot.com/2005/05/new-id-blog-telic-thoughts.html" target="_blank">fun boys</a> at Telic Thoughts) feels that ID is already there. Writing of Well's recent <em>Rivista di Biologia</em> paper (see <a href="http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=312" target="_blank">here</a> for some comments), she notes:
<blockquote>Wells makes clear in the paper that his assumptions are based on the thesis that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole" target="_blank">centriole</a> is a designed object, like a machine, and should be studied as one.</blockquote>
(As an aside, it is probably more true that his <em>thesis</em> is based on the <em>assumption</em> that the centriole is a "designed object".)

<p>Over at <a href="http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/?p=335">Stranger Fruit</a>, I examine Wells' theory in light of design.</p>
