<p>Hey, gang, Wednesday is my birthday! I'm sure many of you have already made your reservations and are planning to show up at my house with armfuls of gifts and bottles of champagne for an evening of wild partying, but if you can't make it, no worries: there's another way you can celebrate. Write something, anything about science or the natural world and post it to your weblog, and then send a link to it to <a href="mailto:grrlscientist@yahoo.com">grrlscientist</a>, <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a>, or <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a>. Then, on 9 March, after all the champagne has been drunk and the revelers have toddled home or passed out on the floor, I'll be able to pull up the laptop, aim my browser at 
<a href="http://girlscientist.blogspot.com/">Living the Scientific Life</a>, and spend some pleasant time seeing what smart people say about science on <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">The Tangled Bank</a>.</p>

<p>C'mon. As a favor to an old man getting older.</p>
