I had a deadline for a "real" science article that was receding into the past at an alarming rate (to my co-author if not the journal editors).  

So, what did I do?  Of course!  I wrote a totally unrelated item about creationist lies from _Answers in Genesis_.  The motivation was when a young creationist was floating big chunks, err, posting large sections from an _Answers in Genesis_ article about the origin of the Moon written (sort of) by Michael Oard. 

John Stear was kind enough to post it on NAiG entitled ["Oard's Moonbeam"](http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/oard_moon_beam_gh.htm).
