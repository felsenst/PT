The following article provides a first-hand account from two members of the Minnesota science standards writing committee of the many and various attempts to incorporate antievolution material into the Minnesota science standards._\]

The state legislature overturned the Profile of Learning standards in April of 2003 with the requirement that new standards in five areas (mathematics, language arts, science, social studies, and art) be developed and implemented by the 2004-2005 school year (see [this page](http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/departments/scr/billsumm/2003-2004/senate/regular/sf0639.htm)).
