The letters on the [_York Dispatch_ webpage](http://www.yorkdispatch.com) are a bit harder to find, but there have been some excellent ones:



* "[Pseudoscientific balderdash](http://www.yorkdispatch.com/Stories/0,1413,138~10028~2649000,00.html)"
* "[Dover board ignores the evidence](http://www.yorkdispatch.com/Stories/0,1413,138~10028~2640537,00.html)"
