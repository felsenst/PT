As I [mentioned in an earlier post](http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2005/08/evolution-in-land-of-toto.html), the Kansas Board of Education has given preliminary approval to a set of science standards that have a strong anti-evolution bias. This bias becomes apparent literally before page one of the standards, and is apparent in any number of ways. Previously, [I blogged](http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2005/08/whats-in-phrase.html) on a change in language early in the document that singles out evolution, making it appear to be more dubious than other theories listed. Today, I am going to begin to examine some of the actual standards and benchmarks most affected by the KBOE's efforts to "improve" the way evolution is taught in their state. This will be the first in a series of posts looking at the specifics, since there are way, way too many objectionable areas to cover in a single post.

I'm going to start with an addition that demonstrates true chutzpah. (For those of you not familiar with the Yiddish term, it is difficult to translate directly, but can best be described as the quality displayed by a man who craps on his neighbor's doorstep, then knocks and asks to borrow some toilet paper.) Kansas' contribution to the art of chutzpah is found on page 78 of the standards, which are [available as a pdf file on the Kansas Department of Education website](http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/scstdworkingdoc7122005.pdf):
