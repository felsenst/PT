In [breaking news](http://www.christianpost.com/article/society/1319/section/aclu.abandons.lawsuit.against.intelligent.design.notice/1.htm) from _The Christian Post_, crack reporters declare:

Just kidding.  This report is totally, 100%, clear-as-day false.  

But this is a [real  live news story that just came across Google News](http://news.google.com/news?tab=gn&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Dover+ACLU&amp;btnG=Search+News).  The "reporter" evidently misread this [Thomas More Law Center press release](http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=275), or read only the title ("[ACLU Abandons Early Effort To Stop School District From Making Students Aware of Controversy Surrounding Evolution](http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=275)").  They appear to have mistakenly concluded that the ACLU _et al._ had given up, and then constructed an entire news story around this assumption. 

It's actually a quite extraordinary bit of self-delusion, especially considering the last sentence in the TMLC press release ("The ACLU lawsuit will continue with a trial expected in early summer.").  I think it highlights the fact that propaganda can have two messages: the official message, with technically accurate (well, sometimes) text, and the emotional message for the public, which is the message that the innocent reader gets.  Put a snappy title on a press release, exude confidence, and declare victory, and, don't you know it, people conclude that you've won!  

This kind of thing is actually quite common in creationist/ID-land, in only slightly less extreme form.  I can't count the number of times where the Discovery Institute or another creationist group has put out a press release, the right-wing echo chamber bounces it around for a few days, and the result that emerges is the emotional message being portrayed as the actual facts on the ground.  In rare cases, enough of a din gets created that someone from a respectable news outlet will repeat the message, at which point the Discovery Institute will quote it in the next press release!  The [peppered moth case](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/iconob.html#moths) is perhaps the most massive example of this engineered disconnect between discourse and reality.

I've saved the _Christian Post_ news story in case they fix it tomorrow.  Fortunately for them they've got it covered:
