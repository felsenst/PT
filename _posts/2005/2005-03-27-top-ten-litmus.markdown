<p>The conservative magazine <a href=http://www.weeklystandard.com/><i>The Weekly Standard</i></a>, apparently not wanting to allow <a href=http://www.commentarymagazine.com><i>Commentary</i></a> to have all the fun, has waded into the anti-evolution biz by publishing <a href=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/005/377xndpp.asp>this miserable article</a> by Paul McHugh.  It is the usual melange of literary arrogance coupled with scientific ignorance.  It does, however, provide a useful opportunity to review the various litmus tests you can apply to distinguish between serious commentators on the one hand, and dishonest hacks on the other.</p>

<p>If the author of the article you are reading uses any of the following devices in making his case:
<ol>
<li>  Make a reference to thought control.
<li>  Bring up <I>Inherit the Wind</I>.
<li>  Imply that evolution is about ideology and not science.
<li>  Pretend that evolution has made no progress since Darwin.
<li>  Use quotations from scientists misleadingly and without indicating their source.
<li>  Bring up Piltdown Man.
<li>  Use the term &ldquo;Darwinian fundamentalist.&rdquo;
<li>  Pretend that the theory of Punctuated Equilibrium refutes core tenets of neo-Darwinism.
<li>  Put words into the mouths of scientists without providing citations.
<li>  Accuse scientists of being dishonest.
</ol>  
then you are almost certainly reading the work of a dishonest hack.  I've fleshed out the details in <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/03/litmus-tests.html>this post</a> over at <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog.</a>
