> When I joined \[the Discovery Institute\] I didn't think they were about bashing evolution. It's pseudo-science, at best ... What they're doing is instigating a conflict between science and religion.

and

> He was shocked, he says, when he saw the Discovery Institute was calling evolution a "theory in crisis."
> 
> "It's laughable: There have been millions of experiments over more than a century that support evolution," he says. "There's always questions being asked about parts of the theory, as there are with any theory, but there's no real scientific controversy about it.
> 
> Davidson began to believe the institute is an "elaborate, clever marketing program" to tear down evolution for religious reasons. He read its writings on intelligent design --- the notion that some of life is so complex it must have been designed --- and found them lacking in scientific merit.
