William Dembski, somewhat startled by the Dover ruling is looking for a positive note and seems to have [found one which I can share](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/6420ap_evolution_debate.html):

> This galvanizes the Christian community," said William Dembski, a leading proponent of the theory and a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, a Seattle think-tank that promotes intelligent design research. "People I'm talking to say we're going to be raising a whole lot more funds now."

Nothing would impress me more if these increased contributions could finally lead to a scientifically relevant contribution of Intelligent Design.

Although, as the Beatles said it so well with their song "\[Money\] can't buy me love", the same may very well apply to scientific relevance.
In the same article, Zylstra provides us with a comment which may help us understand Dembski's return to apologetics
