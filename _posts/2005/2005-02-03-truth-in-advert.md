FAQ: Why isn't intelligent design found published in peer-reviewed science journals?

Before reading further, we recommend that if you are interested in seeing the scientific underpinnings of intelligent design, that you read our article, "[The Science Behind Intelligent Design](http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/idscience.htm) to become familiar with the scientific basis for intelligent design.

I clicked the link "The science behind intelligent design" (http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/idscience.htm_)and was greeted by the following message:


> Page not found

I appreciate the level of honesty here...

The real reason ID is not found in peer-reviewed science journals is because there is no scientific theory of intelligent design. At least not one beyond the God of the Gaps argument (Not X thus Y).
