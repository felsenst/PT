The Discovery Institute's [Wishful Thinking Division](http://www.idthefuture.com) has a piece by Jay Richards arguing against relativity based on an insight derived from a New Yorker article: "[ Did Einstein really show that time is an illusion?](http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?p=179&amp;more=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1)."

Sean Carroll at Perposterous Universe has taken it apart: "[Time-saving tips for understanding Einstein](http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#111267441192632973)."

> And here's a little request for anyone else who wants to point out flaws in Einstein. Whatever else you might think, Einstein was a smart cookie. Nothing he said was sacred (my first published paper proposed a theory that violated some of Einstein's ideas, as have several of my subsequent papers), but you should at least understand what he said before you claim to improve on it. So take a gander at the problem sets for my course in general relativity, and have a go. If you get an average of over 50% on all the sets (as all of the students in my class did), I'll give your ideas a respectful hearing. Otherwise, you should go back and hit the books if you expect anyone to take you seriously.
