Fred Barton has a letter published in the [Lansing State Journal](http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050911/OPINION02/509110732/1087/opinion)

Unfortunately, the only "controversy" is the one created by the institute to attract the attention of the press and general public.

Fred provides some interesting details about the funding of the DI. I found that the original source of this information is a [NY Times article titled "Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive"](http://www.theocracywatch.org/evol_disc_inst_times_aug21_05.htm)

Yet the "Wedge Document" explains that intelligent design is only a means to an end. It says, "Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist world view, and to replace it with science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."

There seems to be need for a minor correction: Fred Barton reports

> "We give for religious purposes," said Thomas McCallie, executive director of the Ahmansons' Foundation. "This is not about science. Darwin was about a metaphysical view of the world."

Thomas McCallie is Executive Vice-President of Strategic Initiatives of the [Maclellan Foundation](http://www.maclellanfdn.org/about/home.asp)

The origin of the confusion? The [original NY Times article](http://www.theocracywatch.org/evol_disc_inst_times_aug21_05.htm) mentioned

> The Ahmansons' founding gift was joined by $450,000 from the MacLellan Foundation, based in Chattanooga, Tenn.
> 
> "We give for religious purposes," said Thomas H. McCallie III, its executive director. "This is not about science, and Darwin wasn't about science. Darwin was about a metaphysical view of the world."
