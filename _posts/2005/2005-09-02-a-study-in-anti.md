<p>Someone calling himself Homunculus has posted [this bit](http://homunculus.redstate.org/story/2005/8/31/234056/414) of anti-evolution insanity over at the right-wing website [RedState.org](http://www.redstate.org).  I give it the business in [this lengthy post](http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/where-can-i-learn-to-be-this-shameless.html) over at [EvolutionBlog](http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com).  Enjoy!</p>
