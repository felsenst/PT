Someone stole my idea.  

In celebration of [Darwin Day](http://www.darwinday.org/home/index.html), someone has set the _Origin of Species_ to [Dub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music), a kind of music related to Reggae.  No, really.    

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2005/Origin Album cover2.jpg" alt="" />

This new artistic endeavor is the creation of the [Genomic Dub Collective](http://www.infection.bham.ac.uk/BPAG/Dub/GDC.html), a group which aims to "create a new musical genre... that celebrates recent successes in the field of genomics and evolutionary biology."  Why someone didn't think of this before, I'll never know.  The group draws talent from a Microbial Genomicist and a Jamaican scientist of some sort.  

Each track is named after or takes inspiration from a chapter of the _Origin_, and you get two bonus tracks, the _Dobzhansky Dance Trance_ and _Ras Darwin_.  (For all you Sheriff John Browns, _Ras_ refers to Erasmus Darwin, Chuck's grandfather.)

You can listen to some samples [here](http://www.infection.bham.ac.uk/BPAG/Dub/Origin/index.html), or you can order the entire thing for Â£3.99 (about the price of a dime bag).  These chaps are just trying to recoup their costs, so don't kill the seed before it grows.
