Not long ago, as previously [noted on the Thumb](/archives/2005/12/bring-out-the-c.html), Cal Thomas made noises in USA Today wondering whether "Darwinists" would show up for a debate on the merits of ID as a scientific enterprise.

That canard was rebutted by Patricia Princehouse of Case Western Reserve University and [Ohio Citizens for Science](http://www.ohioscience.org/), who said in a letter to USA Today:

> The question is, will the designists show? Calls go out every day to present scientific data at scientific conferences. The designists are always busy that decade. Meanwhile, the scientific data supporting evolution continue to pour in on a daily basis and produce spinoff applications that create new medicine, more productive crops, cleaner water and better living for billions of people worldwide.
> 
> The Darwinists show up to work every day in thousands of labs around the globe. Mr. Thomas and Mr. Beckel, your guys are the ones who don't show.
> 
> January. Cleveland. The "science" of ID. Put up or shut up.

In response, some of the expectable wingnuts came out of the woodwork, but finally Bill Dembski accepted the challenge to "put up or shut up".  While some of the formal details are not yet agreed on, Dembski has agreed to the time, date and venue:

Strosacker Hall on the campus of Case Western Reserve University, 7-9 pm January 3, with Ken Miller to represent the "Darwinist" position.  We plan to webcast the event: details will follow as we have them.  Miller will be there regardless of details.

We look forward to seeing Dembski's affirmative evidence for the intelligent design conjecture.  (I myself am hoping to see some validation data, reliability assessments, and calibration runs on Dembski's design detection methodology, "specified complexity".  Anecdotes about political operatives and science fiction movies are a pretty thin empirical base for a putatively paradigm-changing methodology.)
