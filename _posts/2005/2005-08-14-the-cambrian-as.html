<p>I've been reading Valentine's <i>On the Origin of Phyla</i><sup><span style="font-size: 9px;">(<a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226845486/pharyngula-20" target="_new" title="buy this book at amazon">amzn</a>/<a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;bfpid= 0226845486&amp;bfmtype=book" target="_new" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;noble">b&amp;n</a>/<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn= 0226845486&cm_ven=CJ&amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" target="_new" title="buy this book at abebooks">abe</a>/<a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn= 0226845486" target="_new" title="buy this book at Powells">pwll</a>)</span></sup> lately, and I have to tell you, it's a hard slog. This is one of those extremely information-dense science texts that rather gracelessly hammers you with the data and difficult concepts on page after page. I am convinced that James W. Valentine is ten times smarter than I am and knows ten thousand times as much, and it's a struggle to squeeze that volume of knowledge into my miniscule brain pan.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to greatly condense and simplify is his discussion of the Cambrian 'explosion'. Misinterpretation of the Cambrian is one of the many prongs of the creationist assault on science; both <a href="http://www.rae.org/bits05.htm">old school Biblical creationists</a> and the <a href="http://www.csicop.org/creationwatch/designers.html">new stealth creationists of the ID movement</a> have seized upon it as evidence of an abrupt creation&mdash;that a Designer poofed the precursors to all modern forms into existence suddenly, and without precursors, and that this observation contradicts evolutionary theory.</p>

<p>It doesn't. Valentine has an excellent diagram that shows how wrong the creationists are.</p>
