Welcome to the second edition of Ask Prof. Steve Steve.  Today's question comes from Michael in Newark, Delaware.

> Hi, my name is Michael, from Newark, Delaware, and I've noticed you're running a little question and answer session on the Panda's Thumb, a wonderful little blog I've run across and that I read quite faithfully.
> 
> That said, I am a junior at high school, and one of my areas of interest is in the environmental sciences. I am self studying in the area (partially for myself, and partially for the yearly envirothon competitions) and I'm wondering if you could suggest a textbook that is a bit more advanced and more detailed then my current text (Environmental Science, Eighth Edition, written by Richard T. Wright and Bernard J Nebel) or the one I've used in the past (the ecology chapters of Biology, 6th edition, by Campbell and Reece)?
> 
> Thank you kindly for your time and your help.

I contacted a friend of Dr. Wesley Elsberry, [Dr. Jane Packard](http://wfsc.tamu.edu/reports/fsn/page_fourteen.htm) at Texas A&M University, who recommended the following books for [Envirothon](http://www.envirothon.org/):


* [EG Bolen and WL Robinson (1998) _Wildlife Ecology and Management_. Prentice Hall](amazon://013066250X)
* [JE Rodiek and EG Bolen (1991) _Wildlife and habitats in managed landscapes_. Island Press](amazon://1559630531)
* [ML Hunter (2002) _Fundamentals of conservation biology_. Blackwell Science](amazon://0865420297)
