Well, this is an interesting feeling.  I am sitting in Starbucks, in downtown San Francisco, slurping a Frappucino, blogging on my laptop, across the street from the KQED studio (KQED is the San Francisco public radio station that I listen to every day), waiting to go on [KQED's Forum with Michael Krasny](http://www.kqed.org/radio/daily-schedule.jsp#).  Could you get any more stereotypically-NPR-junkie-ish than this?  I mean, apart from being in Minnesota at a Garrison Keillor event?

The show is obviously on [Judge Jones's Intelligent Decision on Intelligent Design](http://www.kqed.org/programs/program-landing.jsp?progID=RD19).  [KQED's audio is streamed on the web](http://www.kqed.org/radio/), so catch the show if you can.  Apparently Casey Luskin will also be on.  I imagine he has a few issues with the decision...
