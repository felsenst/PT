Prof. Steve Steve always seems to have time to spare during his travels.  (Traveling by parcel seems to give him some down time.) Now he and some colleagues have decided to answer questions submitted by students, teachers, and parents.

If you've got a question about science or cultural issues around it, drop the furry professor a line at prof@pandasthumb.org or prof@stevesteve.org.

Please include your name, school, town, and science course, as appropriate.
