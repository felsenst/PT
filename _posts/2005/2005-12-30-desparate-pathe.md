John West of the Discovery Institute has been critiquing Judge Jones' decision in the Dover ID lawsuit over at the DI [Media Complaints Division](http://www.evolutionnews.org) blog. I haven't, for the most part, addressed these posts, since other [Pandas' Thumb](http://www.pandasthumb.org) regulars have more relevant expertise and have been doing a better job at it than I could.
