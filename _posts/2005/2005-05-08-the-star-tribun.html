<p>I put out a <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000992.html">call for letters to the editor</a> of the Minneapolis Star Tribune on the Intelligent Design creationism issue last week. They've <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5390098.html">published a selection of them now</a>, and the pro-biology side is in a strong majority. I've commented on the few creationist letters <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/strib_letters/">here</a>.</p>
