<p>Crocodiles are beasts with an odd mix of features: they are ectothermic (meaning that they derive their body heat from their environment) reptiles, like lizards and snakes, but unlike those smaller critters, they have a fairly sophisticated, high performance cardiovascular system: they have a true four-chambered heart, just like us mammals and birds, and they also have a diaphragmaticus, a muscle analogous to our diaphragm that is used to inflate the lungs. At the same time, their hearts are relatively small&mdash;heart mass is roughly 0.15% of body mass, compared to 0.4%-0.7% of body mass for mammals&mdash;and generates relatively low systemic blood pressure.</p>

<p>It's weird. It's like they have this fancy, sophisticated engine in low-tech chassis, that the animal never revs up to its full potential. How did it get in there, and why do crocodiles have such fancy hearts?</p>

<p>The answer may be that they inherited it from more active, endothermic ancestors.</p>
