Set your irony meter on max.  Imagine if someone had pro-ID talking points from someplace like the Discovery Institute, but transposed them to Utah's new proposal for "[divine design](http://radio.ksl.com/index.php?sid=209621&amp;nid=19)" legislation in 2006. The result: 

> Some will argue that this is an inappropriate mixture of science and religion, but again, divine design does not purport to say who or what the designer was.
> 
> 
> "[Survival of the fittest theory](http://www.thespectrum.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050612/OPINION01/506120325/1014/NEWS01)," _The Spectrum_ (southern Utah)

Looks like another trip to the irony meter store for me...
