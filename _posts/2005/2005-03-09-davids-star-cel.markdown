Check it out--proof of design! The David's Star <a href="http://www.israel21c.org/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Articles%5El934&enPage=BlankPage&enDisplay=view&enDispWhat=object&enVersion=0&enZone=Technology&">appears in a cellular formation in the "Survivor Flower," (<i>Ranunculus asiaticus</i>).</a> It's a miracle almost as impressive as <a href="http://astro.wsu.edu/worthey/astro/html/im-indian-heads/indian.html">John F. Kennedy's face in a hillside in Hawaii.</a>
