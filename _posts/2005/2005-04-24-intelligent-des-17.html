<p>The <a href="http://www.startribune.com/">Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune</a> has a series of articles on their op-ex page today on the Intelligent Design creationism "debate". It's not bad; they set the tone with a set of quotes on the front page from <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5364557.html">Darwin, Einstein, Twain, and Pope Pius XII</a> that provide no comfort to creationists at all.</p>

<p>They've also got an article by yours truly, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5364563.html">Pseudoscience would waste teaching time</a> (which I've also put on <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/yay_im_in_the_star_tribune/">Pharyngula</a>, if you don't want to register with the Strib), and another pro-science article by a staff writer, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5364558.html">When two core beliefs go head to head</a>. There's a peculiar (to this atheist's way of thinking) article on the religious viewpoint, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5364564.html">Truth of faith doesn't depend on this debate</a>, which basically supports the theistic evolutionist's point of view, while arguing for the importance of faith.</p>

<p>Then there is, of course, the token article for "balance", <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5364560.html">Students should learn the weaknesses of evolutionary theory, too</a>. It's by Dave Eaton, who has no credentials in biology at all, but was appointed by the conservative creationist who used to run our state board of education to be on our standards committee. That article is a stunning pile of drivel, as you'll discover if you'd care to read my <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/boo_dave_eaton_is_in_the_star_tribune_today_too/">critique</a>.</p>
