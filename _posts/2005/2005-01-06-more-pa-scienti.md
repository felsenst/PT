According to this blog post by [Michael Weisberg](http://www.phil.upenn.edu/~weisberg/papers.html), "[Penn Faculty Responds to Dover School Board](http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/002895.html)," about 30 members of the [Biology](http://www.bio.upenn.edu/) and [Philosophy](http://www.phil.upenn.edu/) Departments at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/) (an [Official Ivy League School](http://www.intothebest.com/ivy-league/ivy-league-schools.jsp), it is worth mentioning) have signed on to an open letter opposing the "intelligent design" policy of the Dover Area School Board.  

This follows a [similar letter](http://ydr.com/story/letters/51884/) last month by the Biology Department of York College (see the PT post [Doverian doings](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000655.html) and the news story "[College biologists blast Dover](http://ydr.com/story/doverbiology/51833/)").
