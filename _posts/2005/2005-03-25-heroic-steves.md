A nice write-up on Project Steve appeared today in _HERO_, also known as _Higher Education & Research Opportunities_.  The piece, "[Steve-olution](http://www.hero.ac.uk/sites/hero/uk/inside_he/steve_olution.cfm)," consists of an interview with NCSE's always-erudite assistant director Glenn Branch.  If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of [Project Steve](http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18), check out [previous Panda's Thumb posts](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site:www.pandasthumb.org+project+steve) and the [NCSE Project Steve website](http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18).

The [Steve-o-meter](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/5945_the_faqs_2_16_2003.asp) currently sits at 553, in case you were wondering.  The Steve-o-meter on the much-vaunted Discovery Institute list of scientists (well, some of them aren't scientists, but who is counting?) kinda-sorta-vaguely doubting certain parts of "neo-darwinism" reads, at last count, four.

Even if you have heard of Project Steve, you might not have heard the [Steve Song](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8860_the_steve_song__3_15_2005.asp) yet.   Sort of like the [Monty Python spam song](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=spam+song), but slightly different.
