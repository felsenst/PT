On his blog, William Dembski is trying once again to [argue](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/527) that the intelligent designer need not be God: Everyone knows he doesn't mean it, of course, but this is the pretense that they must maintain for purposes of their legal strategy. Unfortunately, their own words keep tripping them up in the attempt. He writes:

> In those programs, Stewart & Co. had some lines that were not only funny but also memorable. The one that sticks out poked fun at ID: "We're not saying that the designer is God, just someone with the same skill-set." That line is now being reused on the debate circuit, with Eugenie Scott, for instance, deploying it this November at a debate at Boston University (go here).

> Although the line is funny, it is not accurate. God's skill-set includes not just ordering matter to display certain patterns but also creating matter in the first place. God, as understood by the world's great monotheistic faiths, is an infinite personal transcendent creator. The designer responsible for biological complexity, by contrast, need only be a being capable of arranging finite material objects to display certain patterns. Accordingly, this designer need not even be infinite. Likewise, that designer need not be personal or transcendent (cf. the "designer" in Stoic philosophy).

Now let's look, for the umpteenth time, at how the Discovery Institute - where Dembski is a senior fellow - [defines](http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php) intelligent design:
