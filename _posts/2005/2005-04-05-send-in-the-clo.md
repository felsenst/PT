In the **I am not making this stuff up category**, the ID crowd is planning on sending a battalion of pseudoscientists to Kansas this May for the upcoming ID Kangaroo Court.  On the front page of the [Intelligent Design Network](http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/sci_standards.htm)'s "we're not promoting ID" [website](http://www.kansasscience2005.com/), we find:

> PUBLIC HEARINGS ON MINORITY REPORT.  A Committee of the State board has scheduled hearings to provide for an in-depth examination of the Minority Report and its proposed changes. The hearings will be conducted in Topeka on May 5, 6 and 7, and May 12, 13 and 14 at a place to be announced.   [CLICK HERE FOR A LIST OF WITNESSES TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY FOR THE MINORITY REPORT](http://www.kansasscience2005.com/Witness%20list%20delivered%20to%20Committee%204-5-04%20wopi.pdf)
> 
> [IDnet science standards website](http://www.kansasscience2005.com/)

And what a list it is!

I'll post it here, for when they change it after they come to their senses:

That's right, the creationists on the Kansas State Board of Education are planning to use Kansas taxpayer funds in order to:

1. Fly in these folks from all over the world -- a collection of scientists outside their fields, non-scientists, and straight-up cranks.
2. Put on a pointless show trial which will be boycotted by most/all real experts on evolution
3. In order to provide political cover for the decision to use the power of the state to change the definition of science in Kansas
4. Actively misinforming Kansas's bright young students and promoting "intelligent design", which Charles Thaxton himself used to call "creationism" before he began promoting "intelligent design"
5. Provoking another round of international scorn and ridicule for the poor citizens of Kansas, and
6. Violating the U.S. Constitution as soon as a public school teacher attempts to teach ID as science
7. Provoking another round of international scorn, plus a nice expensive lawsuit 
8. Which the state will eventually lose.

Sounds like a good plan to me.
