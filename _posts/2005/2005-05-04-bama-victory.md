_From Bob Collins:_

Dear Friends of Science and Education:

**We won!!!**

Tuesday, May 3, was the deadline for bills to pass at least one house of the Alabama Legislature, or they would be dead for the remainder of this session. 

The three creationist bills, HB352, HB716 and SB240, each misnamed "The Academic Freedom Act", all failed to pass even one house by that date, so they have now died a well-deserved death. 

These bills were supported by the Alabama Christian Coalition, who emailed 6 separate "alerts" asking their membership to ask their legislators to support these bills. 

Last year, a creationist bill was approved by the full Senate and the House Education Committee, and was within hours of passing the full Alabama House of Representatives when the legislature ran out of time. We were better organized this year, and it worked!!

Thanks to everyone who called, wrote, faxed, talked to their legislators and/or testified. 

**We made a difference!!!!**

There is no time to rest. This summer and fall, the Alabama State Board of Education will pick science textbooks for our schoolchildren. They will also decide whether to continue use of the embarrassing "Evolution Disclaimer" pasted in the front of every elementary, middle and high school textbook that mentions anything that happened over 6,000 years ago. 

We will be monitoring the textbook selection process and will keep this email list informed.

Thanks again
