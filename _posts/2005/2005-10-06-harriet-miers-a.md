Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers has 


> given 10 percent to 12 percent of her earnings -- "if not more" -- to the evangelical Valley View Christian Church in Dallas, where she has been a congregant for about 25 years


according to Judge Nathan Hecht of the Texas Supreme Court, who has dated Miers.  This [Newsday article](http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-miers-shrinking-wealth,0,3526835.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines) has the details.

What has this to do with Panda's Thumb?  A lot!

It so happens that the ["Useful Links"](http://www.vvcc.org/coollinks.asp) page for Miers's Valley View Christian Church links prominently to the [Creation Evidence Museum](http://www.creationevidence.org/cemframes.html), run by Dr. Carl Baugh, a creationist who is so far out as to have been [strongly criticized by Answers in Genesis and the Creation Science Foundation](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/whatbau.html).  Baugh is perhaps most famous for his [fakey "Paluxy Mantrack" footprints](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/retrack.html), specifically the "Burdick Print," and his [fossilized human finger](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/nbc.html).

A YEC on the Supreme Court?  Connect the dots, people ... connect the dots.
