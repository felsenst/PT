Over on his weblog, William Dembski has [a post](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/212) making reference to [an article](http://www.uncommondescent.com/documentation/Fingerprinting_Documents.pdf) on a means of "fingerprinting" textured surfaces, like paper. It is an interesting article. But look what Dembski has to say about it:

> The Logic of Fingerprinting

> Check out the following article in the July 28th, 2005 issue of Nature, which clearly indicates how improbability arguments can be used to eliminate randomness and infer design: "'Fingerprinting' documents and packaging: Unique surface imperfections serve as an easily identifiable feature in the fight against fraud." I run through the logic here in the first two chapters of The Design Inference.

Well, it is a little troubling how to proceed from this point. Did Dembski fail to _read_ the article? Is Dembski simply spouting something that ID cheerleaders can nod sagely about without regard to whether it happens to accord with reality? Whatever excuse might be given, the plain fact of the matter is that the procedure and principles referred to in the short PDF Dembski cites have nothing whatever to do with Dembski's "design inference", and cannot be forced into the framework Dembski claims.
