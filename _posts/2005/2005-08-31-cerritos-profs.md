Diona Carrillo reports on four Cerritos College science instructors who are bravely standing up against [intelligent design](http://www.talonmarks.com/media/paper327/news/2005/08/31/News/Cerritos.Profs.Weigh.In.On.Intelligent.Design-972166.shtml).

> "Intelligent design is a philosophy, it is not a theory, it's not a scientific theory, it's not even a scientific hypothesis; it's a belief," Constance Boardman, biology instructor said.

The instructors have realized that ID is nothing more than a gap theory

> An emphasis on weaknesses or "holes" and gaps in evolution, is the heart of the intelligent-design movement. 

And they point out how being a Christian and a scientist who accepts evolutionary theory are not contradictory

> "Many people believe that one cannot be a both a scientist and a Christian. I always get questions from my students about how I can subscribe to the theory of evolution and still be a Christian. Science and religion are not mutually exclusive -- they are simply two ways of looking at how the world works. One is not better than the other; they're just different. I think it would truly astonish the general public if they knew how many scientists do hold religious beliefs," Bellas said.
