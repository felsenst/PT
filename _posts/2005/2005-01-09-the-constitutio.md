Matt Brauer, a founding contributor to Panda's Thumb, has been noticeably absent lately.  Courtesy of [Ed Brayton](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/01/id_and_the_cons.php) we now know why.  With Constitutional scholar Stephen Gey and philosopher/historian of science Barbara Forrest (of _Creationism's Trojan Horse_ fame), he has been working on a massive analysis of the constitutionality of teaching ID in public schools, [Is it Science Yet?: Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=590882).  Be warned!  It's a 195-page document.  I won't reproduce the Abstract here: the link above is to it and the working paper itself is available for download at that link.
