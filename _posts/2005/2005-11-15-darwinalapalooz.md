Many have long known and loved the website [The writings of Charles Darwin on the web](http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/) run by John van Wyhe, at the British Library, which has virtually all of Darwin's [published books and articles](http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin2/texts.html) online (yes, Virginia, Darwin wrote over [100 articles](http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin2/texts.html#periodicals) in addition to [all his books](http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin2/texts.html#periodicals)).  And, less well known but very useful, all the volumes of _The Correspondance of Charles Darwin_ are [searchable at Google Print](http://print.google.com/print?q=The+Correspondence+of+Charles+Darwin&amp;btnG=Search+Print&amp;hl=en).

Now, as [reviewed by Niles Eldredge](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030382) in _PLoS Biology_ \[1\], we have online Darwin's early notebooks -- the "Red" and "Transmutation" notebooks -- and manuscripts: the 1842 _Sketch_, the 1844 _Essay_, and the massive unpublished book for which _Origin of Species_ was the "abstract", _Natural Selection_.  The website is [The Darwin Digital Library of Evolution](http://darwinlibrary.amnh.org/) at the American Natural History Museum ([http://darwinlibrary.amnh.org](http://darwinlibrary.amnh.org)).

1. Eldredge, N. 2005. "[Darwin's Other Books: 'Red' and 'Transmutation' Notebooks, 'Sketch,' 'Essay,' and Natural Selection](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030382)." _Public Library of Science: Biology_, 3(11): e382. November 15, 2005.

PS: Hmm, the _PLoS: Biology_ article says that the "Red" and "Transmutation" notebooks are online at the website, but I can't find them. Post a think if you find them.
