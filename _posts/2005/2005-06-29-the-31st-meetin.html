<p>We have a <a href="http://science_boy.blogspot.com/2005/06/31st-meeting-of-tangled-bank-society.html">new edition</a> of the <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">Tangled Bank</a> online, and the host, David Winter of <a href="http://science_boy.blogspot.com/">Science &amp; Sensibility</a>, has introduced a much-needed innovation: refreshment and lunch breaks. You'll need them.</p>

<p>I'll also mention that the <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">Tangled Bank homepage</a> has been revised. It's still a little rough, but the most important feature is now enabled: a <a href="http://tangledbank.net/index/tangledbank/rss_2.0/">Tangled Bank newsfeed</a> that will carry these announcements about new and upcoming editions.</p>
