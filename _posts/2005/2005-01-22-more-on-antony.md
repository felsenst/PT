I went back and reread Antony Flew's essay, "Theology and Falsification," and the ensuing discussion, and posted an essay about them as a Web Exclusive of the magazine _Free Inquiry_, http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/exclusive/young_01-05.htm.  As I conclude there, the young Antony Flew would never have been swayed by an argument from ignorance.

Additionally, may I recommend Victor Stenger's piece, "Flew's Flawed Science," which has (miraculously?) already appeared in the print version of _Free Inquiry_ (February-March, 2005, pp. 17-18)?  You may also find it at http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/stenger_25_2.html.
