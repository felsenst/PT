The Wichita Eagle had an excellent editorial today in support of the boycott of the Kansas state BOE's upcoming kangaroo court meant to showcase Intelligent Design.  (See [ here](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000939.html) for a list of the Intelligent Design illuminati being invited at tax-payer expense)

Here is the editorial in its entirety -- it's short, powerful, and to the point.  â€˜Nuff said, as they say.  

You might consider sending author Randy Scholfield, writing for the Eagle editorial board, a note of appreciation, or writing a letter to the editor in support of the Eagle's opinion.  See [here](http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/news/editorial/4664538.htm) for contact information.

> **Evolution hearings rejected by scientists**
> 
> The nation's scientific community has weighed in on the Kansas Board of Education's efforts to put Darwin on trial.
> 
> They're boycotting en masse.
> 
> This resounding rejection of the hearings speaks volumes about how the mainstream scientific community sees the Kansas evolution "controversy."
> 
> It has no credibility.
> 
> In recent weeks, the Kansas Department of Education staff has failed to find any scientists in Kansas or the nation who want to legitimize the upcoming May hearings with their presence.
> 
> Not one of Kansas' six major universities has agreed to send scientists.
> 
> Not one of the nation's top science organizations has responded to the request.
> 
> For the vast majority of scientists, the "controversy" about the legitimacy of evolutionary theory simply doesn't exist.
> 
> For them, evolution is a cornerstone of modern science in several fields, and its validity and usefulness is beyond dispute.
> 
> And the small number of intelligent design backers who want a forum have not begun to do the real work needed to challenge that consensus.
> 
> Predictably, BOE chairman Steve Abrams, one of three creationists who would preside over the hearings, suggested that the refusal meant the scientific community was incapable of defending evolution.
> 
> "It's almost like they're saying, 'We can't defend what's put out there, so we're not going to participate,'" Mr. Abrams said.
> 
> Well, no. It's almost like they're saying, "This rigged forum, with a predetermined outcome, has no credibility whatsoever in the scientific community. So what's the point?"
> 
> Baiting scientists won't get them to appear. Because as they rightly perceive, the hearings are a political effort to legitimize ID by parading a small number of "experts" before the public.
> 
> The board majority has announced a list of those ID witnesses, and while many have academic Ph.D.s, what they lack is telling: significant publications on ID in major science journals and mainstream conferences.
> 
> Some of them, such as lawyer John Calvert, aren't even scientists.
> 
> What scientists see is a monkey trial. What Kansans should see is a waste of time and money and, once again, a train wreck for the state's image.
