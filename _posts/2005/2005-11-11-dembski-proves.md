William Dembski has finally replied - kind of - to my proof that he has been spreading false claims about why Jeff Shallit didn't testify at the Dover trial. In that post, he continues to prove me right that he is simply not capable of admitting he was wrong even when shown to be wrong beyond any rational doubt. A full reply to his continued obfuscation can be found at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/11/dembski_finally_respondskind_o.php). Comments should be left there.

**Update**: Dembski has posted another non-reply reply, still unwilling to admit he's wrong. I've posted a full response [here](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/11/will_dembski_continue_to_embar.php).
