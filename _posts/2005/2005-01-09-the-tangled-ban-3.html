<p><a href="http://tangledbank.net/">The Tangled Bank</a> has been on a brief hiatus over Christmas, but it's coming back this Wednesday. That means, of course, that you've had a whole month to build up all kinds of spiffy stuff on science, and are anxious to share it with the world. So send a link to your science writing to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a>, or to <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a>. The next edition will be online this January 12 at <a href="http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/">Science and Politics</a>.</p>
