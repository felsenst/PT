The _San Francisco Chronicle_ had an [opinion essay](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/07/10/EDGBBDKPB81.DTL) from _New Scientist_ editor James Randerson yesterday.  See "[80 years later, Scopes trial debate still alive](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/07/10/EDGBBDKPB81.DTL)".  Yesterday, notably, was the 80th Anniversiary of the [Scopes Trial](http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopes.htm), which still informs discussion of all modern battles over evolution education -- and rightly so in my opinion.  The modern situation cannot be understood without William Jennings Bryan and his 1921-1925 anti-evolution crusade.  You think "theory, not fact" policies are new?  Well, Bryan got his crusade going a few years before the 1925 Scopes Trial.  The first antievolution law was passed in Oklahoma in 1923, followed by Bryan's home state of Florida.  1924 was a legislative off-year, but in the _Scopes_ era some states took nonlegislative actions.  According to Ed Larson, _Trial and Error_ (2003, p. 75):

> Supplementing this legislative activity, some state and local educational boards took the initiative in moving against evolutionary teaching.  A year before the _Scopes_ trial, the state Board of Education in California had directed teachers to present Darwinism "as a theory only"....

(Other action was subsequently taken by the North Carolina Board of Education, the Texas Textbook Commission (sound familiar?), and the Louisiana Superintendent of Education.)

NPR's [On the Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/) did a [story, "Evolving Coverage"](http://www.onthemedia.org/) yesterday on the _Scopes_ media coverage -- one interesting factoid is that they rolled wire all the way down to Dayton to pipe the audio out to national radio stations.  And _All Things Considered_ has a [timeline, photo series, and story collection](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4723956) on _Scopes_ then and now.

Hat-tip to Red State Rabble for the [url to SF Chronicle](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_redstaterabble_archive.html) and [Scopes coverage](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_redstaterabble_archive.html). RSR has lots of [good stuff in general](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/).
