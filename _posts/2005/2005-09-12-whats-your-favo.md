Dembski can be observed quote mining Dawkins and making some ironic statements in a recent posting on UncommenDescent.

As opposed to 'rigorous empirical scientists' like Dembski he probable means? Of course there are some interesting problems with his 'logic'. First of all Dawkins is among thousands if not tens of thousands of capable scientists who move evolutionary theory forward. What does ID have to offer? Poof.... 

But Dembski himself can be observed making some very interesting claims, worthy of an 'empirical scientist'...

You're asking me to play a game: "Provide as much detail in terms of possible causal mechanisms for your ID position as I do for my Darwinian position." ID is not a mechanistic theory, and it's not ID's task to match your pathetic level of detail in telling mechanistic stories. If ID is correct and an intelligence is responsible and indispensable for certain structures, then it makes no sense to try to ape your method of connecting the dots. True, there may be dots to be connected. But there may also be fundamental discontinuities, and with IC systems that is what ID is discovering.

Or in Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science & Theology (1999), Dembski can be observed making the following comments

WAD wrote:

> "If we take seriously the word-flesh Christology of Chalcedon (i.e. the doctrine that Christ is fully human and fully divine) and view Christ as the telos toward which God is drawing the whole of creation, then any view of the sciences that leaves Christ out of the picture must be seen as fundamentally deficient."

Or the following quotes

The "let he who is without sin, cast the first stone" story in the Bible would have been an important lesson to some ID proponents.
