Howdy from Harrisburg!  I would like to apologize for shirking my blogging responsibilities regarding the _Kitzmiller_ case -- NCSE is consulting for the plaintiffs, talking to the media, and hopefully blogging, but doing the first two has excluded the latter until now.  We did get a chance to do some podcasting, which I believe Wes has put up.

Today court is starting at 9:30 rather than 9:00 so I have a bit of time.  All I wanted to say for the moment was GO READ "[Have you ever really looked at intelligent design?](http://ydr.com/story/doverbiology/87427/)" by Mike Argento.  This is the best short summary that I've seen of Rob Pennock's fantastic expert testimony on Wednesday.

For more excellent coverage, see [Dover Biology](http://ydr.com/news/doverbiology/) at the always-on-top of things _York Daily Record_, particularly Lauri Lebo's story "[Witness bashes intelligent design](http://ydr.com/news/doverbiology/)."
