Back in January I seem to remember the Thomas More Law Center declaring "[A Revolution in Evolution Is Underway](http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=281)."  But today, according to the Associated Press, "[Santorum says will break ties to law firm that represented school district on intelligent design](http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20051222-0801-evolutiondebate-santorum.html)."  Now, Santorum was on the TMLC board, and encouraged the Dover Area School Board early on -- see for example his January 23, 2005, op-ed in the _Allentown \[PA\] Morning Call_, entitled "[A Balanced Approach to Teaching Evolution](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News&amp;id=2396)," (helpfully now hosted on the [Discovery Institute website](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News&amp;id=2396)) wherein Santorum wrote, **"The Dover Area School District has taken a step in the right direction by attempting to teach the controversy of evolution."**

But, I guess that's what poor Thomas More gets for repeatedly citing Santorum and his [attempted amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/7202_ncse_compilation_on_santorum_a_6_13_2002.asp) -- Santorum's name came up 36 times in the [trial transcripts](http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?page_id=11), in fact.

While we're discussing law firms, it is worth checking out the press releases and related information of the [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org/religion/intelligentdesign/23158prs20051220.html) (and [letters they've received](http://www.aclu.org/religion/intelligentdesign/23127res20051219.html)), [Americans United](http://www.au.org/site/News2?abbr=pr&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=7725&amp;security=1002&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1241), and the 600-pound gorilla in this case, [Pepper-Hamilton](http://www.pepperlaw.com/news.cfm?ID=922.0).  Sign up for the first two, and send all three your compliments -- they each made a heavy investment in this case, and even if the judge awards some fees after the win, it is highly unlikely they will recoup all of their costs.
