<p>I'm going to be watching my television every night next week&hellip;except that I'm going to be in New York on Thursday. I wonder if I can get in to see it directly?</p>

<p>The series is running on basic cable through Thursday. If you don't have cable, or are living in one of those countries that doesn't get obscure American comedy programs, you can watch [clips of the programs online](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/videos/most_recent/index.jhtml).</p>
