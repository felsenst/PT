<p>&hellip;because articles about wild sex are popping up all over the place. Carl Zimmer gets into the act with the story of <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/03/30/love_darts_in_the_backyard.php">love darts</a>, a snail's way of tweaking its mate's endocrine system and doing a little kinky body piercing while they're at it. And if you're more interested in how arachnids do it with palpal specializations than molluscan harpoons, I've got an article on <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/spider_kama_sutra/">how spiders mate</a>. I guess this is the time of year when an evolutionist's fancy turns to thoughts of exotic courtship rituals.</p>

<p>Zimmer also comments on that parental duty of telling one's children about the Facts of Life&hellip;it's hard to judge whether biologists are at an advantage or are handicapped in that regard. I have no problem telling my kids how sex works, but I fear I might sound more like a chapter from <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805063323/pharyngula-20"><i>Dr Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation</i></a> than your usual American chordate.</p>
