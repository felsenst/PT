I have been trying all morning to find an answer to the question of whether last night's elections, by changing the school board and, perhaps, the policy of that board, will make the Kitzmiller case moot or not. The answer does not appear to be as simple as one might think at first. After consulting with several prominent legal scholars, I have posted my understanding of this issue in all its various aspects at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2005/11/the_dover_case_and_the_school.php). Any legal types who have anything to add, or corrections to make of my understanding of it, please comment there.
