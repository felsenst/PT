<p>Compare these two: <a href="http://answersingenesis.org/docs2005/0412zimmer.asp">Carl Wieland of Answers in Genesis</a> vs. <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/04/12/blinding_new_evidence.php">Carl Zimmer</a>. It's no contest. Zimmer refers to the scientific literature and accurately describes recent advances in AIDS research, while the creationist evades the key points, makes up false assertions about the data, references out-of-date creationist misinterpretations, and flings out non sequiturs wildly.</p>

<p>This is <i>typical</i>.</p>

<p>Funniest comment in Wieland's article: the suggestion that Zimmer should have "checked this website [AiG] first". Yeah, and maybe he should have also visited the circus and consulted a few dancing monkeys, too.</p>
