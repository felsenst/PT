<p>I think <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/789/">Steve</a>
<a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/comments/783/">Fuller</a> has had 
<a href="/archives/2005/12/more-pomo-comme.html">more</a> than 
<a href="/archives/2005/12/and-a-shout-out.html">enough</a>
<a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=1096">attention</a>
<a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=1115">paid</a>
to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=1094">him</a> lately, don't you? There's a new linebacker piling on, though, and I thought this article was such a <a href="http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/2005/12/31/lord-percy-prof-fuller-spot-the-difference/">nice, lucid skewering</a> that I had to bring it to everyone's attention. And it begins with a lovely quote from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/"><i>Black Adder</i></a>! I'm always a sucker for British comic cynicism.</p>

<p>It's remarkable how association with the ID movement has become such an excellent marker for vacuous, uninformed poseurs. Fuller is just one of the more recent in a long series.</p>
