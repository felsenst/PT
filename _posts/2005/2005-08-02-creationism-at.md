There will be a session on creationism presented at this year's GSA Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City (October 16--19, 2005).
["T103. Is it Science? Strategies for Addressing Creationism in the Classroom and the Community"](http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/session_16171.htm) has 16 presentations from a range of science professionals.  There are some familiar names (Meert, Scott, Wise) but happily more unfamiliar ones.  Hopefully there will be a Proceedings published.

I opened comments after some hesitation.  Please restrict yourselves to comments about the conference abstracts, or your teaching experience.  Off topic comments will be deleted.
