Recently I had the opportunity to visit some of my relatives at the Panda Reserve in Chungdu, China.  I was invited to visit the Reserve by my friend Dr. Steve "Number 42" Case.  Number 42, besides being one of the original Project Steve Steves, is also co-chairperson of the Kansas Science Standards Writing Committee as well as Director of the Center for Research on Learning at the University of Kansas.

It was certainly moving to see my ancestral home and native habitat.  I don't run into many pandas in the scientific circles I inhabit, nor many real bamboo stands for dinner.

I imagine that Number 42 is enjoying doing research in China right now rather than dealing with the continuing shenanigans of the state  Board of Education back in Kansas.  He tells me that his next  stop  is Zhengzhou, the place where KU recently acquired fossil dinosaur  eggs from.  He is going to see if he can acquire some - maybe I'll be  able to visit him there also.
