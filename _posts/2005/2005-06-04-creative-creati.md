[The Ferrett](http://www.livejournal.com/users/theferrett/519211.html) has a description of an "interesting" graphic novel.

> The evil fallen angels stampede the dinosaurs toward **Noah's Ark**, hoping to destroy it. . . .  The flood waters drowned and killed the dinosaurs. . . .  This event is _not_ a fable and _not_ a "myth". . .  It is a verifiable scientific **_fact_**!

[PZ](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/why_is_it_called_biblical_literalism/) has some more commentary.
