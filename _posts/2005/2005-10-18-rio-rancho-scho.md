The Rio Rancho (NM) School District adopted a slickly-worded "Science" policy in August, which many fear will open up the classrooms of this Intel bedroom community to "Intelligent Design."  (See earlier reports on the Thumb [here](/archives/2005/08/rio-rancho-nm-s.html), [here](/archives/2005/09/rio-rancho-nm-u.html), [here](/archives/2005/09/more-reaction-t.html), [here](/archives/2005/09/steve-steve-arr.html), and [here](/archives/2005/09/rio-rancho-boar.html).)

> As a federal judge hears arguments over whether a Pennsylvania school district can include "intelligent design" in its biology curriculum, Dan Barbour fears the New Mexico high school where he works could face a similar showdown. The school board in Rio Rancho, N.M., voted in August to allow the discussion of alternative theories to evolution in high school science class. Critics say that could mean intelligent design, and some faculty are averse to teaching a concept whose scientific validity has been questioned, said Barbour, the school's science and math director.
