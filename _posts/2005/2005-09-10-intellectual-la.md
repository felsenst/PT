Dr Matthew Chalmers from the Institute of Physics presents his comments in [The Sunday Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2088-1774243,00.html) of September 11

But he goes one step too far. By suggesting that it is reasonable to discuss ID as a possible alternative to evolutionary theory in school science lessons he has sadly fallen into the same trap of so many others in this recent non-debate.

Does Liddle also think that A-level biology should include a short module on the virgin birth as an alternative to sexual reproduction, or perhaps a homework assignment about life after death? After all, millions of people believe in those.

Not wasting any words he concludes

> Intelligent design is at best religious-right extremism; at worst, intellectual laziness. 

There you have it...
