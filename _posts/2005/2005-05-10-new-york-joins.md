[A bill](http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A08036&amp;sh=t) has been introduced in New York that would require "all pupils in grades kindergarten through twelve in all public schools in the state \[to\] receive instruction in both theories of intelligent design and evolution."  Hopefully this is a reminder that creationism is not a political concern for education in just "red" states.

Additionally, Florida's ["Academic Freedom" Act](http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/loadDoc.aspx?FileName=_h0837__.doc&amp;DocumentType=Bill&amp;BillNumber=0837&amp;Session=2005) has died.  It would [have allowed](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2005/FL/996_controversial_florida_legislat_5_6_2005.asp) students to sue teachers who stated that evolution is a fact.
