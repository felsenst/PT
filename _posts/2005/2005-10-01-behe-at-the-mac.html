<p>Michael Behe was in my neck of the woods last night, and gave a talk titled <i>"Toward an Intelligent Understanding of the Intelligent Design Hypothesis"</i>. There was absolutely nothing new in it, no evidence, no hypotheses, no nothin'&hellip;so don't trouble yourself to read <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/behe_at_the_maclaurin_institute/">my account of the event</a> unless you are obsessive about seeing what the anti-evolutionists of the Discovery Institute are up to.</p>
