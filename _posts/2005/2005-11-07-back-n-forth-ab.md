There's been some interesting discussion over on [SciAm Observations](http://blog.sciam.com/) about the evolution of infectious diseases, and notably, influenza. It all started with editor John Rennie's post, discussing an article on H5N1 written by Wendy Orent, here:

[Part I](http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=don_t_fear_the_bird_reaper&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1)

Wendy Orent and evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald both replied in Part II and Part III, respectively:

[Part III](http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=bird_reaper_pt_iii_paul_ewald_replies&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1)

Both discussed Rennie's mention of a critique of Orent's article on the public health blog, [Effect Measure](http://www.effectmeasure.blogspot.com/).  The pseudomynous Revere from that blog then replied in Part IV:
