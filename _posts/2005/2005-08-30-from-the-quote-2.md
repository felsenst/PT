In the August 29 issue of the Scientist, Phil Skell writes in his opinion piece "Why Do We Invoke Darwin? Evolutionary theory contributes little to experimental biology" the following:

Phil Skell wrote:

I decided to investigate [the quote](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/75501482). Guess what?

The same quote was mined on ARN and Grape Ape [responded](http://www.arn.org/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=print_topic;f=14;t=000838)

Grape Ape wrote:

More and more issues in biology, from diverse questions about human nature to the vulnerability of ecosystems, are increasingly seen as reflecting evolutionary events. A spate of popular books on evolution testifies to the development. If we are to fully understand these matters, however, we need to understand the processes of evolution that, ultimately, underlie them.

So I did a search on [Google](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%E2%80%9CEvolution+would+appear+to+be+the+indispensable+unifying+idea+and%2C) and found the quote mined on the Discover Institute in Skell's article. A creationist website [John Mark Ministries](http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/15170.htm), Answer In Genesis [Feedback](http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/2004/1203.asp)  and a Skeptics page about an AIF [debate](http://www.skeptics.com.au/articles/creationdebate2.htm)

Is it not time to put to rest this canard?
