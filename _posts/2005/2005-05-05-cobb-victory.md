The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has denied the Cobb County School District's request to stay the removal of the evolution disclaimers stuck on thirty-four thousand biology textbooks until after the circuit has ruled on the district's appeal.  The Marietta Daily Journal has [the scoop](http://www.mdjonline.com/268/10182289.txt):

> Marietta attorney Michael Manely, who, along with the American Civil Liberties Union, defended the plaintiffs in district court, said that to get a stay, it has to be proven that the case is likely to succeed on its own merits.
> 
> "This showed it's not likely to prevail," Manely said. "It's the first serious nail in the coffin from the Court of Appeals. They are expressing their preliminary thoughts on the subject. This is like a preview of what is certain to come. It tells the board that this corpse is beginning to smell really bad."

> School staff has already experimented with removing the stickers, using such things as nail polish. Removing so many stickers will not be easy, she said.
> 
> "I'm going to offer to help take out the stickers," said east Cobb parent Jeffrey Selman, who filed suit against the school board in August 2001, along with the ACLU, claiming the stickers were unconstitutional.
> 
> "I bet I can get a whole bunch of people to help them," Selman said. "God bless the judges. They can see right through this sham."

Prof. Steve Steve has also offered to come back to Georgia to do his part in removing the disclaimers.
