<p>With the Smithsonian Institute/<i>Privileged Planet</i> brouhaha, the subject of cosmological ID has been buzzing about the blogosphere lately.  In particular, as noted by other PT contributors, physicist William Jeffreys has written <a href=http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/784_review_of_emthe_privileged_p_6_7_2005.asp>this excellent, scathing reivew</A> of the book version of <i>The Privileged Planet.</i>  But David Heddle, author of the blog <a href=http://helives.blogspot.com>He Lives</a>, was less impressed.  He vents his spleen <a href=http://helives.blogspot.com/2005_06_01_helives_archive.html>here</a>.</p>

<p>Over at <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</a> I have offered <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/what-is-cosmological-fine-tuning.html>these thoughts</a> on the matter.  I argue, among other things, that cosmological fine-tuning is more plausibly interpreted as evidence for multiple universes than it is for ID.  And in <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/heddle-on-falsifiability-of-id.html>this entry</a> I offer some thoughts on Heddle's arguments regarding the falsifiability, or lack thereof, of cosmological ID.  Enjoy!</p>
