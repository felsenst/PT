The National Catholic Reporter discusses [Follow up news:  SchÃ¶nborn and evolution](http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word080505.htm)

Vatican Correspondent John L. Allen concludes:

Allen wrote:

> In that light, observers say, SchÃ¶nborn's view does not seem to court a new Galileo affair, putting the church at odds with scientific discoveries. He's making a philosophical point, not a scientific one. In the end, he's warning that Christianity cannot accept a universe without God, and it's fairly difficult to argue with that.
