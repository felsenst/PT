<p>Gregg Easterbrook is a <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/easterbrook_a_21st_century_ron_burgundy/">scientific lightweight</a> with a <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/000806.html">long</a>,

<a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/000798.html">history</a> of 
<a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/001258.html">goofy ideas</a>; an apologist for

<a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/zimmer_hands_easterbrook_his_head/">shill for the Discovery Institute</a>. He apparently has written well-regarded columns on football, but when it comes to science, his credibility is on the negative side of the number line. One of the characteristics of the incompetent, though, is that they do not recognize their own failings, so once again <a href="http://beliefnet.com/story/86/story_8686.html">Easterbrook sallies forth, this time against Richard Dawkins</a>. It's the nut against the nutcracker; the outcome is foreordained.</p>

<p>My personal position on Dawkins is somewhat complicated. I think he is definitely one of the best writers on our side of the argument; I think he is largely in the right on much of the science; I also think he is regrettably neglectful of development's role in evolution, which biases his thinking in ways that don't align with my biases; and I think he is dead-on target in his criticisms of religion's effect on society. I'm a bit different than many, who seem to think his description of science is exactly right and wish he'd shut up about religion: I think his science lacks some significant nuances, and want him to continue to speak out with vigor and clarity on the affliction of fundamentalism.</p>

<p>Easterbrook, of course, is outraged at the arrogance of the damned atheist.</p>
