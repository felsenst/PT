The recent Kansas creationist kangaroo court hearings on evolution run by three creationist members of the Kansas State Board of Education (see [**here**](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/05/waterloo_delayed_again.html) and [**here**](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/05/the_dog_ate_my_homework.html) for stories) and the [**previous (1999) debacle**](http://www.kcfs.org/KsSciSt1999-2001/Fliers_articles/Localcontroland%20more.pdf) in Kansas are having consquences for higher education in that state.  In [**a story in the Lawrence Journal-World**](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/aug/30/within_science_circles/) the Provost of Kansas University said 

> For the state to be portrayed repeatedly in the national press as being anti-science does damage to this university.  The frustration is you fight this reputation problem every step of the way.

KU dropped three places in the most recent U.S. News & World Report rankings of universities.

Kathy Martin, one of the creationist members of the Kansas State BOE, pooh-poohed the issue, saying 

> I feel most people could probably care less," she said. "I really don't think it's that big of a deal except in certain circles.

"Certain circles" presumably refers to those who actually know something about the issue.

This is a wakeup call for Ohio, my principal concern.  Consider these events: 

The recent discovery of [**the scandal associated with Bryan Leonard's Ph.D.**](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001127.html) candidacy at the Ohio State University

 Ohio's so-called [ **"Critical Analysis" model lesson plan**](http://science2.marion.ohio-state.edu/ohioscience/Controversy_Guide.html) drawn straight from Jonathan Wells's trash science (= _Icons of Evolution_), and

 Ohio's [**ethically impaired**](http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/08/18/ohio.governor.ap/) but politically powerful Governor [**pressuring the State BOE**](http://science2.marion.ohio-state.edu/ohioscience/TaftBackedID.html) to weaken the science standards, which allowed that lesson plan to be considered. 

None of this bodes well for the Ohio State University.
