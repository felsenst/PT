> The cardinal has muddied the waters of the discourse between science and religion. Religion, he seems to be saying, much to the delight of the Evangelicals, can dictate scientific conclusions -- such as it once dictated that the sun revolved around the Earth on the basis of a couple of verses in the book of Exodus.

> The cardinal's assertion will upset most Catholic scientists and confuse many of the educated laity (something that the present pope has always deplored). Moreover, it provides the New York Times another chance to pursue its anti-Catholic bias. The cardinal has "redefined" the issue. Now a political alliance between Catholics and Evangelicals will be easier to achieve. A cardinal can't do that. Only the pope and/or a Gen eral Council (acting in union with the pope) defines anything. The traditional bias against Catholics among conservative Christians (which my research shows still exists) makes such a political coalition most unlikely.

Although I know the physics and the meterology behind that sound, the beauty of the surf on the beach assures me that there is Beauty in the universe of which that sound is a reflection. Love too. Good night, lake. Good night, God.
