<p>Here's something to give you all the heebie-jeebies: <a href="http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/evolution-on-oreilly-factor.html">Jason Rosenhouse watches Bill O'Reilly expounding on Intelligent Design creationism</a>. 
This is quite possibly the most ridiculous, extravagantly bogus mangling of basic scientific concepts I have seen in my entire career, but Jason manages to discuss it far more dispassionately than I ever could. There is also a  <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2005/01/19/oreilly_defends_intelligent_design_your_belly_laugh_for_the_day.php">transcript available online</a>.</p>

<p>Check it out only if you've got your blood pressure under control. Mild sedatives recommended before reading.</p>
