I wrote a brief post awhile back about some funny/sad [AiG cartoons](/archives/2005/11/in-the-its-so-s.html), which morphed into a discussion of snake evolution in the comments section.  Dr. Fry's comments in that discussion led to 2 follow-up posts on his work on the evolution of snake venom, and in the second thread, [here](/archives/2005/11/followup-to-dra.html), Steviepinhead has mentioned a new Archaeopteryx finding with better-preserved feet:

And until a recent discovery of an extremely well-preserved skeleton of the earliest-known bird species, Archaeopteryx, scientists believed it too had a "perching toe."

It left clear impressions of its wing and tail feathers in the limestone it was encased in, and the skull is the best-preserved of all the 10 specimens ever discovered. But it may be the feet that prove to be the most important aspect of the find.

There was some initial discussion in the PT thread I mentioned above (Steviepinhead's post is [here](/archives/2005/11/followup-to-dra.html#comment-60978) to begin the topic), but I thought it was new enough to begin a new discussion of the findings in a thread of its own.  So...discuss!
