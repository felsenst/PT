<p>There is a <a href=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/editorial/outlook/3036400> truly excellent op-ed</a> from Barry Lynn today in <i>The Houston Chronicle.</i>  Here's an excerpt I especially liked:

<blockquote>
<p>Phillip Johnson, a former law professor who pioneered intelligent design, told a conservative religious audience a few years ago that his goal is to use intelligent design to spread doubts about evolution and then introduce people to &ldquo;the truth&rdquo; of the Bible and &ldquo;the question of sin.&rdquo; Ultimately, Johnson said, he wants people to be &ldquo;introduced to Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the end result of what you are doing is aimed at religious conversion, then it's evangelism, not science. It belongs in a house of worship, not a public school.</p>
</blockquote>

Well said.</p>

<p>Alas, not everyone agrees with Lynn.  The Discovery Institute's Seth Cooper <a href=http://www.evolutionnews.org/csc.php/2005/02/16/rev_lynn_s_separation_of_truth_from_cari>has weighed in</a> with a sulky blog entry about it.</p>

<p>But Cooper allows blogger Darrick Dean do <a href=http://sciencewatch.blogspot.com/2005/02/more-of-same-from-naturalism-defenders.html>the heavy lifting</a> for him.  Over at <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</a> I have posted entries about Lynn, Cooper and Dean, available <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/lynn-states-it-plain.html>here</a>, <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/cooper-demurs.html>here</a> and <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/dean-on-lynn.html>here</a>, respectively.  Enjoy! </p>
