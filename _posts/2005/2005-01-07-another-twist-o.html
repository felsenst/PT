<p>All I want to say is <a href="http://ydr.com/story/main/54594/">bravo to the high school faculty in Dover</a>!</p>

<blockquote><p>All but one teacher in the Dover Area School District's high school science department signed a letter Thursday requesting that they be allowed to "opt out" of reading the "Intelligent Design Theory" statement meant for students.</p>

<p>"We do not believe this is science," said high school science teacher Jen Miller.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>While the teachers do not cite the Constitution, their written request does cite Pennsylvania's Code of Professional Practice and Conduct for Educators.</p>

<p>"We believe that reading the ('intelligent design') statement violates our responsibility as educators as set forth in the code," Miller said. "Students are allowed to opt out from hearing the statement. We should be allowed to opt out from reading it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Aren't science teachers wonderful people?</p>

<p>But wait&hellip;the letter wasn't signed unanimously.</p>
<blockquote><p>The one teacher who did not sign the letter does not teach biology.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not surprised.</p>
