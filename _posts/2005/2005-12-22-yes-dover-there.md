Last summer I travel to Fairbanks, Alaska to attend the Evolution 2005 conference at the University of Alaska.  During my travels, I visited [North Pole](http://www.northpolealaska.com/) and stopped by [Santa Claus's house](http://www.santaclaushouse.com/).  Santa was there that day and eager to hear my Christmas list.

I can't say exactly what all I asked for because otherwise it won't come true.  However, the jolly old man came through for me earlier this week.  Yes, Dover, there is a Santa Claus.

On my way out I feed Donner, who was looking a little warm in the surprisingly hot Alaska afternoon.

I have many more pictures from my Alaska trip and will post the rest of them when I catch another break.
