In [One side can be wrong](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1559743,00.html) **Accepting 'intelligent design' in science classrooms would have disastrous consequences**, Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne express their feelings and findings on intelligent design.

> It sounds so reasonable, doesn't it? Such a modest proposal. Why not teach "both sides" and let the children decide for themselves? As President Bush said, "You're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." At first hearing, everything about the phrase "both sides" warms the hearts of educators like ourselves.

This is a very good article which goes into quite some depth to describe what is wrong with intelligent design while also addressing what is and is not know about the 'gaps' so often abused by ID proponents.

It's good to see how more and more scientists are standing up to defend science. I believe we should thank George W. for his ill-timed remarks.
