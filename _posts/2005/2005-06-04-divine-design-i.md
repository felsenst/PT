According to [the Salt Lake Tribune](http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_2777333), backers of "divine design" want equal time in Utah public schools.

> Sen. Chris Buttars, R-West Jordan, plans to lead the fight for instruction of divine design in Utah public schools. He wants to defuse some of the expected controversy by avoiding the term "creationism" altogether.
> 
> Instead, he favors "divine design," sometimes called "intelligent design," which "doesn't preach religion," he said. "The only people who will be upset about this are atheists."
> 
> Supporters of intelligent design say nature is so complex that it could not have occurred without the guidance of some higher power, maybe God, maybe something else.
> 
> They say this differs from traditional creationists who believe that God created the Earth, and argue the distinction means its inclusion in public school curriculum would not violate church-state separation.

> "The divine design is a counter to the kids' belief that we all come from monkeys. Because we didn't," said the conservative Republican and retired director of a private school for troubled boys. "It shocks me that our schools are teaching evolution as fact."
> 
> Buttars doesn't disregard evolution completely, rather he believes God is the creator, but His creations have evolved within their own species.
> 
> "We get different types of dogs and different types of cats, but you have never seen a 'dat,' " he said.
