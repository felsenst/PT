...and has spawned some press coverage, [here](http://www.zwire.com/site/tab1.cfm?newsid=15586126&amp;BRD=2700&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=554316&amp;rfi=6) in the Ames Tribune and [here](http://ee.gazetteonline.com/Default/Skins/CRGazette/Client.asp?Skin=CRGazette&amp;Enter=true&amp;Daily=TGC&amp;GZ=T&amp;AppName=1) in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, making us the first state to have faculty from all Regent universities speak out against intelligent design. I'll briefly address some of the comments.

In the first article, U of I physics professor (and signer of the DI's ["Scientific dissent from Darwinism" petition](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=443)) Fred Skiff elaborates one giant strawman:


> "It's part of science to consider what blinders you might be wearing," Skiff said. "Materialists put conditions on science that things can only exist if they satisfy materialism. I think that is a mistake."

Edited to add:  bummer, as noted in the comments, [Missouri beat us to the punch.](http://web.missouri.edu/%7Eesiwww/evolution.html) 

Edited again to add:  I see Dembski is claiming " ID proponents were bypassed" when we circulated this.  Not true at all--I don't even know who on the faculty is an "ID proponent" besides the already-mentioned Fred Skiff (and I can't say how it was circulated within the physics department, if it went there at all).  It was mostly passed along through word-of-mouth, and generally sent to entire departments or colleges at a time.  The idea that we were bypassing certain people on a faculty this large is a joke.
