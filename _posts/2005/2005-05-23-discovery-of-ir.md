[BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4566319.stm) is reporting that scientists have discovered the [irony centers of the brain](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41176000/gif/_41176509_sarcasm_416.gif).  The only reason this study is surprising is that PT posters and readers were not the primary research subjects.  Most of us had our irony neurons burned out long ago (I bet you would see some nice dark spots on brain scans, right next to our hypertrophied pun centers).  This is why we have to compensate with [irony meters](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/talk.origins/msg/fa9be0e832644ae3?hl=en), which, sadly, [have been taking quite a beating](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001036.html) lately.

In case you were wondering, this BBC graphic should answer all your questions about neurological irony detection:
