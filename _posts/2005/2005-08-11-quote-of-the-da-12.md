> Yes, proponents of intelligent design understand the eye...but only as one example, not as the basis of a general principle. 'Oh, yes, we know all about the eye,' they say (we paraphrase). 'We're not going to ask what use half an eye is. That's simple-minded nonsense.' So instead, they ask what use half a bacterial flagellum is, and thereby repeat the identical error in a different context.
