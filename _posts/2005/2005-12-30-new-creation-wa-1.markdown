<p>If you're just dying to know what Judge Jones actually wrote in his 139 page opinion, but for some reason you don't want to slog through the whole thing, feel free to have a look at <a href=http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/dover.html>my Cliff's Notes version</a>.  I go through the entire opinion, summarizing every major point from page one to page 139.  Enjoy!</p>
