<p>After taking the last five weeks off, <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</a> has now returned to a regular publication schedule.  Updates will be added daily, Monday-Friday, generally in the late afternoon or early evening, Eastern time.  Today I have a series of posts about the reactions from various cable news channels to Bush's endorsement of ID.  Enjoy!</p>
