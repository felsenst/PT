He cited a recent challenging review by Seipel and Schmid that discusses the evolution of triploblasty in the metazoa&mdash;it made me rethink some of my assumptions about germ layer phylogeny, anyway, so I thought I'd try to summarize it here. The story is clear, but I realized as I started to put it together that jeez, but we developmental biologists use a lot of jargon.
