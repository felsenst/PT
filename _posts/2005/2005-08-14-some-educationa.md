This is only peripherally on topic here, and I am plugging my own blog again, but over at [The Questionable Authority](thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com), I have a couple of pictures that go a long way toward answering that classic presidential question: "[Why isn't our children learning?](http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2005/08/why-isnt-our-children-learning.html)"
