The Seattle PI [reports](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1103AP_Vatican_Evolution.html) that Rev. George Coyne, the Jesuit director of the Vatican Observatory, has observed the obvious namely that "Intelligent design isn't science even though it pretends to be,..."

While the Catholic church obviously supports 'intelligent design', it also seems to realize that 'Intelligent Design' is scientifically vacuous.
