[Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,176354,00.html) reports that [Professor Paul Mirecki](http://members.aol.com/pmirecki/pmcv.htm) will be teaching a class on intelligent design.

The class, titled "Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies" will be taught in the religious studies department of the university.

John Calvert did not take long to respond. Always good for a laugh, he comments:

> John Calvert, an attorney and managing director of the Intelligent Design Network in Johnson County, said Mirecki will go down in history as a laughingstock.
> 
> "To equate intelligent design to mythology is really an absurdity, and it's just another example of labeling anybody who proposes (intelligent design) to be simply a religious nut," Calvert said. "That's the reason for this little charade."

Oh the irony...
