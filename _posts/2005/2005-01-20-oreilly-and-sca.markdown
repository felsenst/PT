Thanks to P. Z. Myers and one of my commenters for directing me to transcript of the O'Reilly segment I reported on yesterday.  I have fisked the entire thing in <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/oreilly-again.html>this entry</A>, over at EvolutionBlog.  O'Reilly's insanity is so complex and multi-layered, at times it is difficult to compose a reply.

I have also prepared <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/evolution-on-scarborough-country.html>this entry</A> about yet another awful segment on this subject from last Friday's Scarborough Country.  Enjoy!
