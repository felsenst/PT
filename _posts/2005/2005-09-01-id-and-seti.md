Russell Durbin reports:

> Discovery Institute C(R)SC fellows and friends are fond of citing SETI as an example of intelligent design theory in action. While we at Panda's Thumb are certain that the CRSC had no intention of implying that SETI endorses their claims to scientific respectability, we thought we  might help them avoid any misunderstanding by passing along the following link:

> [Intelligent Design and Evolution at the White House](http://www.seti.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ktJ2J9MMIsE&amp;b=194993&amp;ct=1324903)

The article mentions

> The reporter got it right: there is an ongoing debate over intelligent design vs. evolution, at least in the media and in politics. There is not a debate in the greater scientific community about the validity of evolution. Further, the vast majority of scientists do not consider intelligent design as a viable alternative to evolution.

And in case the reader may not understand that SETI is rejecting Intelligent Design

> Obviously, scientists and educators understand that intelligent design has no place in the classroom. Intelligent design is, simply, one of several varieties of creationism that offer religious explanations for the origin and current condition of the natural world. As such, it does not merit being taught alongside evolution as a "school of thought." There's significant legal precedent from US Supreme Court that creationism - in any clothing - does not belong in the American classrooms. Teaching creationism is in violation of the separation of church and state, and has been ruled illegal by the US Supreme Court in several cases. It's unfortunate that the President apparently does not understand that science is not equivalent to a belief system but is description of how the natural world works. Creationism, including intelligent design, is a religious point of view, not science.
