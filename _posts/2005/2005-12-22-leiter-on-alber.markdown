University of Chicago Law Professor Albert Alschuler <a href="http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2005/12/the_dover_intel.html">posted some comments</a> on <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/051220_kitzmiller_342.pdf">the <em>Kitzmiller </em>decision</a> that are embarrassingly bad in many places. I can do no better than Brian Leiter in refuting them---<a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2005/12/more_reactions__1.html">his post deserves to be read in its entirety.</a> But I do want to emphasize one point. Alschuler accuses Judge Jones of declaring that "[t]he first amendment makes intelligent design unmentionable in the classroom." As Leiter says, this is not even <em>close </em>to what Judge Jones said. Unfortunately, I expect this accusation to be repeated over and over again by those who profit greatly off of their image as a persecuted minority, hounded by evil atheist courts. All we can do is reiterate that it is not true.

The Court found that the government of Pennsylvania---acting through a local school board---has no authority to endorse a religious viewpoint by declaring that Intelligent Design is scientifically valid. But any <em>individual </em>in the Dover school district is free, today as always, to declare his <em>personal </em>belief in Intelligent Design, to tell other people about Intelligent Design, and to encourage people to read <em>Of Pandas And People. </em>What they are not free to do is to propagate ID <em>on the government's dime and on the government's time.</em> They are not free to spend <em>taxpayer money </em>on it, or put the government's seal of approval on it. But they are absolutely free to propagate it on their own time and in their own ways---indeed, it would be entirely illegal for the government to stop them from doing so.

I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous it is to confuse <em>your right to do something</em> with <em>your power to do something with government money or with government authority.</em> These two things are worlds apart. The Free Exercise Clause entirely protects the former. The Establishment Clause, however, severely restricts the latter---as it ought to.
