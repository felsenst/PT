According to [a report in the AJC](http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cobb/0105/15evolution.html), the Cobb County Board of Education will decide Monday in a closed door meeting with their lawyers whether to appeal Judge Cooper's ruling.  I am hopeful that, if their real intention was to improve science education, the board will accept the decision of the Court and that of biologists and biology educators that the disclaimer hurts biology education and should be removed.
