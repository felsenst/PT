Dr. Eugenie Scott of the [National Center for Science Education](http://www.ncseweb.org) put a comment on a thread here that delivers some interesting news on the nuisance lawsuit filed earlier this year: it was never served on NCSE, and in fact was withdrawn in July, although the filer failed to notify NCSE of this action.

Dr. Eugenie C. Scott wrote:

> This is not the first time that Mr. Caldwell has claimed that I maliciously wrote in the _California Wild_ article that he submitted YEC books to the district. Castigating me for my not having explained the source of that error is  is disingenuous. After Mr. Caldwell filed suit against NCSE and me personally, my lawyer advised me to not make any public statements. And of course Mr. Caldwell has threatened some members of PT and PT itself for linking to the CW article, is sueing the Roseville school district, and also attempted to subpoena NCSE's records in regards to THAT lawsuit -- you get the picture. The advice seemed prudent. Not being able to speak out has chafed greatly, as NCSE staff and my family are very aware. I have long wanted to get the truth out about Mr. Caldwell's claims, but have been hampered by his own actions in suing me, and twice threatening to sue the California Academy of Sciences.

He had sent us a settlement offer, we replied, and my lawyer and I have been waiting for his response to our reply-- but we have heard nothing from him. In fact, although he filed the suit in April, he never even bothered to formally serve me with notice of his legal action! Now, shortly after receiving our reply to his settlement offer, he has moved to dismiss the lawsuit.

This should not be mistaken for any acquiescence to Caldwell's claims, nor certainly lack of confidence in the strength of our legal position! But you can't take certain actions until certain procedural events take place -- one usually gets served when one gets sued, for example, and then the clock starts ticking for response. We've been waiting around for Caldwell, but I'm happy to say that since he dismissed his lawsuit, I am not longer under those constraints.
