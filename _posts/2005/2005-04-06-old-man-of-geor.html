   <p>A fabulously interesting hominin skull has been found at the Dmanisi site in Georgia. It's old in two different and significant ways: the individual lived 1.77 million years ago, and he was ancient at death, almost completely toothless. He'd also been toothless for several years before death, judging by the complete resorption of the tooth sockets.</p>

<p>It's a touchingly human thing, that so long ago our ancestors weren't entirely brutish, but did care for the infirm to some degree.</p>
