<p>We skip <i>one</i> edition, and all the science contributions pile up&mdash;this week's <a href="http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/2005/01/tangled-bank-19.html">Tangled Bank #19</a> is <b>huge</b>. Work is going to come to a standstill all across the country as everyone stops for a few hours to read about science&hellip;but we will be a better nation for it.</p>

<p>We're going to be sure not to miss any dates from now on, so do check our <a href="http://tangledbank.net">Tangled Bank schedule and honor roll</a>, and submit a link to the next edition for the 26<sup>th</sup> of January, or volunteer to be a host!</p>
