<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2006/Flying_SM_cosmic.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />Flying Spaghetti Monsterism has officially hit the bigtime.  See "[Spaghetti Monster Stringing Us Along](http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-fsm0812.artaug12,0,1036163.story?&amp;track=rss)," in the _Hartford Courant_.  This national press attention obviously proves that there is a scientific controversy over [His Noodly Appendage](http://www.venganza.org/), which should be taught in public school science classrooms in Kansas and elsewhere.  Really, the views of [Pastafarians](http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-fsm0812.artaug12,0,1036163.story?&amp;track=rss) are just as legitimate as anyone else's views on origins, so they deserve promotion at state expense also.  Or are you against free speech and academic freedom?
