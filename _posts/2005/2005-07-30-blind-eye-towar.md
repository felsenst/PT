Robert Crowther at the Center for ~~the Renewal~~ of Science and Culture reports on a short op-ed by Bruce Chapman in the [Washington Post](http://www.evolutionnews.org/index.php?title=blind_eye_toward_intelligent_design&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1)

Chapman is wrong. Not only is there no real scientific case against Charles Darwin's theory of Evolution beyond a discussion of the relative importance of the various mechanisms, but there is also no scientific alternative called 'Intelligent Design'.

Chapman wrote:

> Darwin apologists are happy to opine on religion and politics, of course. What they will not do is address the growing evidence against Darwin's theory.

This statement by Chapman is clearly wrong since not only are Darwin "apologists" happy to explore the relative importance of the various mechanisms of evolution, but they are also very willing and able to show that 'the growing evidence against Darwin's theory' is not a scientific claim but rather a socio-political claim. One need not go further than Panda's Thumb [TalkDesign](http://www.talkdesign.org/) or [TalkOrigins ](http://talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-creationists.html) and [TalkReason](http://talkreason.org/). In addition various papers and books have been published addressing not only the major flaws and shortcomings in the arguments of Intelligent Design, but also documenting the socio-religious underpinnings of the ID movement. Barbara Forrest And Paul Gross describe in [Creationism's Trojan Horse](http://www.creationismstrojanhorse.com/) 

> in full detail the claims and operations of the "Intelligent Design" movement, the most recent manifestation of American creationism. Explaining and analyzing what "design theorists" call their "Wedge Strategy," they document the Wedge's aggressive political and public relations campaigning. The most notable feature of the movement's purportedly new scientific paradigm is an abject failure to produce scientific data in support of its claims or even a coherent research program. Instead, the Wedge maintains a crowded nationwide schedule of lectures, popular publications for its mostly conservative Christian constituency, and media appearances, all sustained by generous funding from religious benefactors. The Wedge has intruded itself efficiently into educational politics at local, state, and national levels.

The Discovery Instute's [Wedge Document](http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/wedge.html) describes the goals

Of course, any time the media reports on the scientific vacuity of ID, it must be a misrepresentation.

Chapman wrote:

> The theory holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.

There is no theory of Intelligent Design. Intelligent Design is a scientifically vacuous concept which relies on our ignorance.

And don't just take the opinions from scientists on this matter \[1\] but also take note of such brave ID proponents as Gilder or Nelson who have come forward to express their doubts:

Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of notions such as 'irreducible complexity' and 'specified complexity'- but, as yet, no general theory of biological design."

> Proponents of Intelligent Design theory seek to ground a scientific research program that appeals to teleology within the context of biological explanation. As such, Intelligent Design theory must contain principles to guide researchers. I argue for a disjunction: either Dembski's ID theory lacks content, or it succumbs to the methodological problems associated with creation science-problems that Dembski explicitly attempts to avoid. The only concept of a designer permitted by Dembski's Explanatory Filter is too weak to give the sorts of explanations which we are entitled to expect from those sciences, such as archeology, that use effect-to-cause reasoning. The new spin put upon ID theory-that it is best construed as a 'metascientific hypothesis'-fails for roughly the same reason.

The argument from order or from utility are shown to be indeterminate, circular, to rest on psychological as opposed to factual certainty, or to be insupportable as regards humans but possibly not bacteria, respectively. The argument from the special intelligibility of the universe specifically to human science does not survive comparison with the capacities of other organisms. Finally, the argument from the unlikelihood of physical constants is vitiated by modern cosmogonic theory and recrudesces the God-of-the-gaps.
