<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smerinthus_ocellatus"><i>Smerinthus ocellatus</i></a> &ndash; caterpillar of eyed hawk moth. The photographer writes, "Photographed in my garden underneath a Kilmarnock willow (<i>Salix caprea</i>). At first I mistook it for a leaf. I had a problem identifying this as it is similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manduca_sexta">caterpillar found in America</a>."
