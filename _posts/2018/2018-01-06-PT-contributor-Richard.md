We received sad news today from Eric Holdener, a teacher in instructional technology at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio:

<blockquote>... I started following [Panda's Thumb] during the Kitzmiller case, and I also gained a deeper appreciation for my fellow Gambier native Dick Hoppe who posted those riveting (and often quite humorous) updates. <br/><br/>

I am sorrowed to pass along the news that Dick has passed away [on January 3], but I thought you might want to know and perhaps you might want to post something to the PT. The <a href="http://mountvernonnews.com/article/2018/01/04/richard-b-hoppe/">initial obituary</a> in our local newspaper is rather thin (link below), but I imagine that Kenyon will have a more detailed announcement soon. I could pass that along to you when that comes to us here. </blockquote>

I never met Dick Hoppe, but we corresponded a bit, and I liked him. I probably read almost every word he posted. I remember particularly following his reports on the Freshwater case, which must have lasted at least 2 years and probably ended with <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/01/freshwater-summ-1.html">this dispatch</a>. One of his <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/10/sayonara-evolut.html">last reports</a> mourned (if that is not too strong a word) the closing of Jason Rosenhouse's EvolutionBlog.

Here is another remembrance from one of the PT contributors:

<blockquote>Saddened to hear of Richard Hoppe's death.  I never met him, but
his many comments on PT were a high point for me &ndash; he conveyed
his expert knowledge of physics in forceful, clear, and humorous ways.<br/><br/>

He really knew his stuff, and cared about getting science across to his readers.</blockquote>

I will update you in the comments as soon as I learn anything more, such as a more complete announcement. In the meantime, I encourage you to leave any remembrances in the comments as well.
