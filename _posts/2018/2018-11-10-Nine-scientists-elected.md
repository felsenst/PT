Nine scientists have been newly elected to the U.S. Congress this year. One, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, has been elected to the U.S. Senate; the eight others, to the House of Representatives. I will not paraphrase them, but you can find articles in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/11/07/how-science-fared-midterm-elections/">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2018-midterms-8-new-scientists-elected-to-house-senate-2018-11">Business Insider</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18071348/new-congress-members-science-background-national-policy-nuclear-engineer-nurse">The Verge</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/scientists-win-first-time-runs-for-congress--senate--65048">The Scientist</a> lists all the scientists who ran for Federal or State office, including the three holdovers who won reelection to the House. <i>The Scientist</i> also lists 11 scientists who ran for Federal office and lost. Their definition of <i>scientist</i> is fairly broad and includes physicians, dentists, and engineers. Jacky Rosen, for example, is a software developer. Of the 11 (counting holdovers) who were elected, eight are Democrats; the three Republicans are physicians, according to The Verge.
