<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Coopers_Hawk/id"><i>Accipiter cooperii</i></a> -- Cooper's hawk, Sanitas Valley trail, September, 2018. A moment after I took this picture, the hawk took off toward a nearby tree and caught a smaller bird that had just hastily departed from that tree. That unfortunate bird expressed extreme displeasure, and then the two were gone into a copse. Joe Felsenstein helped with the identification.
