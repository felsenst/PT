There are still spaces for more teams of two each at the 
<a href="https://avida-ed.msu.edu/active-lens-train-the-trainers-workshop-2018-edition/">4th annual Avida-ED Active LENS Workshop</a> 
at the North Carolina A&T University in Greensboro, North Carolina, June 14-16, 2018,
so the application deadline is being extended.
Travel and expenses will be covered by the workshop sponsors for
educators wishing to learn how to use the <a href="http://avida-ed.msu.edu">Avida-ED artificial life program</a> in teaching evolution.


From the <a href="http://bwng.us/projects/activelens/ActiveLENSEducatorWorkshop4Flyer.pdf">flyer</a>:

> Avida is a digital evolution software platform used to study evolutionary processes, and harness evolution
> to solve engineering problems. Avida-ED is a free, user-friendly, browser-based version of Avida
> developed specifically for educational purposes, with a graphical user interface and visualizations that
> allow the user to observe evolution in action. (See http://avida-ed.msu.edu/ for more information.)
> Organisms within this software are self-replicating computer programs, competing for computational
> resources supplied by the environment. Their replication is imperfect, resulting in mutations in some of
> their offspring, which may alter the ability of those organisms to make use of their environmental
> resources. Populations studied over the course of generations therefore display all of the elements
> necessary for evolution by natural selection: variation, inheritance, selection, and time.

Disclosure: I was formerly part of the Avida-ED project (2008-2009), and my spouse, Dr. Diane Blackwood, 
is the current software architect for Avida-ED.
