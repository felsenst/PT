I am a little bit late out of the starting blocks, but last week's (August 5) entire issue of <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> was devoted to a single article, "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html">Losing Earth</a>: The decade we almost stopped climate change. A tragedy in two acts," by Nathaniel Rich, with remarkable (and depressing) aerial photographs by George Steinmetz. If you read nothing else, read the Epilogue, which about sums up what a botch we made of the solution during the years 1979-1989. And, by all means, look at the photographs and read the captions.
