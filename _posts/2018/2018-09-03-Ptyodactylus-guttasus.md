<a href="http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Ptyodactylus&species=guttatus"><i>Ptyodactylus guttatus HEYDEN, 1827</i></a> &ndash; Sinai fan-fingered gecko. The photographer writes, "What I personally like most about the picture (and what you cannot really see on the image) is the location where I took it. The gecko sits on some of the stone tracery on the outside of the Chapel of Ascension on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The red dots at the hip of the individual are parasitic mites, full of gecko blood."</figcaption>
