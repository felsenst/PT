He will be awarded an autographed copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Evolution-Works-Creationism-Fails/dp/0813545501">Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)</a> by Matt Young and Paul Strode.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Incahuasi"><i>Isla Incahuasi</i></a> (Casa del Inca), informally called "Cactus Island." The photographer writes, "The Isla Incahuasi sits near the center of the of the Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, the world's largest salt flat.
  The predominant large cactus is <i>Echinopsis atacamensis</i>, which is native to Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.  The Island is many kilometers from the nearest mainland and hosts an interesting subset of the local native vegetation.  Despite its isolated location and scant rainfall, it is dramatically covered with abundant plant life."</figcaption>
