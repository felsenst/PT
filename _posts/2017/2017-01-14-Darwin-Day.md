The Clergy Letter Project's [Evolution Weekend](http://theclergyletterproject.org/rel_evolution_weekend_2017.html) this year coincides with [Darwin Day](http://darwinday.org/events/); Darwin's birthday was February 12, 1809. 

The anniversary of Darwin's birth is Sunday, February 12. You may find a great many events, so far beginning February 6 in Tyler, Texas, and ending February 18 in Fargo, North Dakota, on the Darwin Day website. That is not counting several events in 2018 and one in 2019. You may add your own event [here](http://darwinday.org/wp-login.php?action=register).

The Clergy Letter Project states, "260 Congregations from 43 States and the District of Columbia representing 7 Countries are scheduled to participate in Evolution Weekend 2017." You may see a very long list organized by state and then foreign country on their website. Not all of the events will occur precisely during Evolution Weekend, so it will be wise to check.

As a member of a territorial species, I looked for Colorado, where I live, and found one celebration of Darwin Day in Salida, hosted by the Central Colorado Humanists. Five churches and one synagogue, mine not among them, are planning Evolution Weekend events in Colorado. Look around; you may find events near you.
