Mr. Phelps writes, "I recently excavated this specimen of <i>B. digitata</i> from the Curdsville Formation of the Lexington Group (Late Ordovician). I had intended on carefully excavating the layer in the future, but this specimen was in fragments at the surface. I glued it back together then removed a lot of the excess shale from between the 'arms.'  The specimen could use more cleaning."
