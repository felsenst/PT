You can read about it in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/22/trump-budget-seeks-huge-cuts-to-disease-prevention-and-medical-research-departments/">Washington Post</a> or <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/05/what-s-trump-s-2018-budget-request-science">Science</a>, but <a href="https://www.aip.org/fyi/2017/trump-budget-slashes-science-confrontation-congress-looms">FYI</a>, by the American Institute of Physics, possibly sums it up the best:

<ul><li>The Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy* – down 109&nbsp;%</li>
<li>DOE's Renewable Energy – down 70&nbsp;%</li>
<li>DOE's Fossil Energy – down 58&nbsp;%</li>
<li>NOAA Research – down 32&nbsp;%</li>
<li>DOE's Nuclear Energy – down 31&nbsp;%</li></ul>

<ul><li>National Institute of Standards and Technology – down 23&nbsp;%</li>
<li>National Institutes of Health – down 22&nbsp;%</li>
<li>DOE's Office of Science – down 17&nbsp;%</li>
<li>United States Geological Survey – down 15&nbsp;%</li>
<li>National Science Foundation – down 11&nbsp;%</li></ul>

<ul><li>Department of Defense Science and Technology – 5.8&nbsp;%</li>
<li>NASA Science – down 0.9&nbsp;%</li>
<li>National Nuclear Security Administration – up 7.7&nbsp;%</li></ul>

<ul><li>&#42; The figure 109&nbsp;% is correct and has something to do with prior year balances.</li></ul>


In dollars, as opposed to percentage, according to FYI, the largest hit is to NIH, which will lose approximately $7.4 billion compared with the FY17 budget. NNSA, by contrast, gains about $1 billion.

According to the <i>Science</i> and the <i>Post</i> articles, reaction from scientists and science organizations has been predictable. Fortunately, the <i>Post</i> reports in a headline, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/even-some-republicans-balk-at-trumps-plan-for-steep-budget-cuts/2017/05/23/9bf202f8-3f62-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html">Even some Republicans balk at Trump's plan for steep budget cuts</a>. We shall see.
