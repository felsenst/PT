<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis"><i>Tenodera sinensis</i> sp.</a> &ndash; Chinese praying mantis. Praying mantises have adaptive compound eyes that allow them to see at night. By day, light entry into the compound eyes is controlled by pigments near the surface. The pigments migrate away from the surface at night, allowing the eyes to gather more light. It is the insect version of having bigger pupils at night.
