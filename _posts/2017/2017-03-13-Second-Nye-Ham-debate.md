Bill Nye will debate Ken Ham tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Apparently Mr. Nye accompanied Mr. Ham on a guided tour of the "Ark", and their interaction is billed as a "<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/countering-the-culture/nye-ham-second-debate/">second debate</a>." Their debate will be live-streamed tonight. I have a conflict and will not be able to watch it; I assume it will be pulled and offered on DVD in return for money. If anyone wants to watch it and comment here, I will not try to stop them.
