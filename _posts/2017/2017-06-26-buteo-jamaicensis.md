<a href="https://coloradooutdoorsmag.com/2016/03/08/what-bird-is-that/"><i>Buteo jamaicensis</i></a> &ndash; red-tailed hawk. These two emerged from the nest and spread their wings for a few days, but they did not fly while I was watching. After a few more days they disappeared. I assumed they were juveniles getting ready to fledge. I further assume that someone will correct me if that is not so.
