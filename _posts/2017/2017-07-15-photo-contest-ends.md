<strong>Update</strong>, July 19: The deadline for submitting entries has passed. To be safe, though, I will list the names of those who have submitted photographs. If you submitted something to thousandwords@pandasthumb.org and your name does not appear, please contact us at pandasphotocontest@gmail.com. OK, here goes: DullienV, DullienR, Fugate, Andreas, RiceJ, RiceA, May, Kocher, Sturtevant, Susek, Phelps. If your name is not on the list and should be, please contact us right away. 

<strong>Update</strong>, July 18: We have received a report that thousandwords@pandasthumb.org may not work properly, and a test message did not go through (or at least was not forwarded correctly). Please send submissions to pandasphotocontest@gmail.com.

If you did not get a response, please assume that your submission was not received and send it again to the pandasphotocontest address.
