I am looking for a volunteer or two who are skilled
at designing websites to help with some outstanding
requests here at the Panda's Thumb.
Basically, I am currently too busy to implement
several of the features that have been requested by
our authors and readers.

I am looking for someone with the following skills and experience.

* Static website design (if you try to use PHP, Prof. Steve Steve will cut you)
* Jekyll
* Javascript, CSS, HTML
* Git and GitHub

The source code for PT is hosted on GitHub and is built on an external server
using Jekyll. Everything is served statically using Nginx.
No PHP, CGI, Java, or other backends are used.

If you are interested in volunteering, please leave a comment below with
evidence of your skillsets.

Thanks.
