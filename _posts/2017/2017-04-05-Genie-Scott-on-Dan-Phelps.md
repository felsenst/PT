We reported in February that the National Center for Science Education <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2017/02/Phelps-Wins.html">has honored Dan Phelps</a> with a Friend of Darwin award. Yesterday, Genie Scott, the former director of NCSE, followed up with a <a href="https://ncse.com/blog/2017/03/friend-darwin-daniel-j-phelps-0018494">blog post</a> further honoring Mr. Phelps. It seems that Mr. Phelps, an occasional contributor and sometime source for PT, has been at it for around 30 years. You can read about him in the blog.
