The snowflakes grew under carefully controlled conditions. You may see a movie of the snowflakes forming in the *Times* article cited in the caption. They seem to be clearing out an area in which to grow; the surrounding dots are water droplets. For more photographs, see [here](http://www.snowcrystals.com/photos/photos.html). For an explanation of why all snowflakes are not identical and more, see [here](http://www.snowcrystals.com/science/science.html).
