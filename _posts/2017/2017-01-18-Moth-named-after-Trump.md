A new species of moth with tiny wings and a shock of yellow scales on its forehead has been named after Donald Trump, according to an [article in the *Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/17/this-new-species-of-moth-has-yellowish-white-scales-on-its-head-it-is-named-for-donald-trump/). Specifically, the entomologist Vazrick Nazari discovered the new species and named it *Neopalpa donaldtrumpi*. You may see two photographs of *N. donaldtrumpi* in the *Post* article.

I checked quickly to ascertain whether Steven Colbert or Andy Borowitz works for the *Post*, and apparently they do not. I followed a [link](http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=11411) to Mr. Nazari's article and read the abstract. Yes, it is real. The *Post* article, by Sarah Larimer, also noted that a fish and other organisms have been named after Barack Obama.

Some of the comments are not to be missed.
