Well, OK, it is not exactly a march, but (as Glenn Branch of <a href="https://ncse.com/">NCSE</a> informs us) the Discovery Institute is teaming up with the Heritage Foundation for <a href="https://www.evolutionnews.org/2017/04/march-for-science-or-march-for-scientism-meyer-richards-smith-to-converge-on-heritage-foundation-april-19/">a provocative event</a> in which they will characterize the March for Science as a march for conformity or a march for scientism. In other words, they will describe the overarching scientific consensus on, say, evolution or anthropogenic climate change as mere expressions of scientific conformity or, when all else fails, accuse the real experts of "scientism."

The principal purveyors of such anti-science will be Stephen Meyer, Jay Richards, and Wesley Smith of the Discovery Institute, and Katie Tubb of the Heritage Foundation.

The <a href="http://www.heritage.org/environment/event/march-science-or-march-scientism-understanding-the-real-threats-science-america">event</a>, or should I say nonevent? will be live-streamed on Wednesday, April 19, 2017, 12:00-1:00 pm, Eastern Daylight Time.
