During the 2006 Annual meeting of the AAAS in St Louis, the "Center for Public Engagement with Science and Technology" organized [an event](http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/pe/evoline/index.shtml#) for St Louis teachers called:  AAAS Evolution on the Front Line.

The resources include powerpoints of the presentations and videos which I understand will be added at a later time.

Dr. Gilbert S. Omenn, AAAS President and Professor of Medicine, Genetics and Public Health, University of Michigan presented the [results from the Teacher Survey](http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/pe/evoline/ppt/omenn.ppt)

> Focus Groups -- Four Recurring Themes
> 
> Teachers often don't teach human evolution if it's not assessed by statewide standardized testing.
> 
> When teachers verbally "frame" evolution to preempt resistance in the classroom, some students may interpret the words as equivocation.
> 
> Parochial school teachers may experience less pressure than their public-school counterparts to insert non-scientific views into science classrooms. 
> 
> Students may be far less concerned about evolution versus creationism and intelligent design than many of the adults around them. 

Ms. Linda K. Froschauer, President-Elect, NSTA; Middle-School Teacher and K-8 Science Department Chair, Weston Public Schools, CT presented on the [Scope of the problem today](http://www.aaas.org/programs/centers/pe/evoline/ppt/froschauer.ppt)

> "School started this week and a lovely well-spoken .......  youngster came up to me and asked to be excused  any time that I referred to evolution in class.
> 
> I explained that that might be every day; 
> 
> I asked her to let her parents know."

> "There is an extremely vocal creationist minority  in my community who call up the administration whenever I start to cover anything having to do with evolution.
> 
> Their students snigger and sneer in the classroom  when even a video mentions anything having to do  with \[evolution\]."
