Phillip E. Johnson may believe six inconsistent things before breakfast, but we don't have to follow his example -- or trust his latest inconsistent pronouncement.

The [Sacramento Bee recently ran an article](http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/education/story/14254103p-15069795c.html) featuring an interview with Phillip E. Johnson, the "godfather" of the "intelligent design" movement.

> His main disappointment is that the issue hasn't made more headway in the mainstream scientific community.
> 
> Johnson said his intent never was to use public school education as the forum for his ideas. In fact, he said he opposed the efforts by the "well-intentioned but foolish" school board in Dover, Pa., to require teachers to present intelligent design as a viable scientific theory.
> 
> Instead, he hoped to ignite a debate in universities and the higher echelon of scientific thinkers.
> 
> But Johnson said he takes comfort knowing he helped fuel the debate that has taken place so far. "Perhaps we've done as much as we can do in one generation."

What has Johnson said and done in the past concerning this topic, though? Is it really the case that public K-12 school curricula were not an issue for Johnson at any point? What we can see from the record is that public education at the K-12 level has, in fact, been a particular hobby-horse of Johnson's. I also went through all of Johnson's "Wedge Updates" archived at "Access Research Network" to see what Johnson had to say about public education there.
