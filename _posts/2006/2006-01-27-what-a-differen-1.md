The Discovery Institute, over at their [Media Complaints Division Blog](http://www.evolutionnews.org/), has posted [yet another article](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/but_is_id_science.html) castigating Judge Jones for ruling that Intelligent Design is unscientific. 

This one, by a second-year law student, takes more or less the same tone as the others:

> In this detailed analysis, I will take a close look at Judge Jones reasoning, and evaluate the potential legal basis for determining the scientific status of ID. Ultimately, I find that the Kitzmiller opinion has no legal basis to determine the scientific status of intelligent design, and as such, is merely the opinion of one man, not the law as proclaimed by a federal district court judge.

Ed Brayton, over at Dispatches, has [already fisked](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/01/dis_new_contributor_on_judge_j.php) the substance of that post. I'd like to take a second to look at something else: the Discovery Institute's pre-decision view of how the judge should rule.
