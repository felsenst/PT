PT readers may recall [Jack Krebs's post](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/05/kcpress_forum_a_1.html) from May that recounted the behavior of Kansas State Department of Education Director of Communications David Awbrey at the Kansas City Press Club on May 4, 2006.  To summarize, [Krebs caught Awbrey](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/05/kcpress_forum_a_1.html) asserting that evolution and science were just atheistic metaphysics, and, according to Awbrey, so were dinosaurs: 

> Anyone see the origin, anyone see the Big Bang, anyone see the dinosaurs? These are all metaphysical speculations by people who look at the same evidence and disagree with what they see.

Krebs later challenged Awbrey at the forum, and Awbrey denied these statements, but Krebs taped the whole thing and posted the quotes and recordings here on PT.

Well, fast forward a month, and now [Awbrey has resigned](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/jun/15/education_department_spokesman_leaves_job/) after only six months on the job.  Coincidence?  We report, you decide.
