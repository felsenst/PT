<img src="http://www.thelutheran.org/images/photo/06october/jones.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />Today the magazine _The Lutheran_ has made its [interview](http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=6096) with Judge Jones [freely available](http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=6096) on its website.  October's [cover story](http://www.thelutheran.org/article/issue.cfm?issue=132) is on science and religion, and includes a [series of stories](http://www.thelutheran.org/article/issue.cfm?issue=132) on the Lutheran perspective on the evolution/creationism issue.  My parents get _The Lutheran_, so now my strange job has landed in their mailbox.  There is no escape!

The Jones interview is notable for including some details on Jones's experience in becoming a judge -- quite an involved process -- and on his religious upbringing, which has not been treated in depth elsewhere.  We also get some more on his views on the relationship between the judiciary and politics, which Jones has made into a bit of a personal quest following the post-decision claim that Jones had "stabbed in the back" his political allies.
