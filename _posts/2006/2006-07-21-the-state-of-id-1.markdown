<p>How bad have things gotten for the ID folks?  Well, they used to brag about all of the great discoveries waiting to be made by any biologist willing to take an ID perspective.  Since that hasn't quite panned out, to put it kindly, they've lowered their standards a bit.  If William Dembski's <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1343">latest blog entry</a> is to be believed, now you need only use a phrase like &ldquo;sophisticated design principles&rdquo; in a biology paper to have the ID folks claim you as one of their own. </p>

<p>I have the full details <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2006/07/the_state_of_id_research.php">in this post</a>, over at EvolutionBlog.  Comments can be left there.</p>
