[Reasonable Kansans](http://reasonablekansans.blogspot.com/) has a positive writeup of a lecture Behe gave yesterday in Kansas.

It's worth a read to keep up with the continuously morphing public relations campaign of the "intelligent design" activists: [Reasonable Kansans: Behe Lecture](http://reasonablekansans.blogspot.com/2006/12/behe-lecture_07.html).
