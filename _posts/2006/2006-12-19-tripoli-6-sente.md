The 5 Bulgarian and 1 Palestinian health workers accused of having infected Lybian patients with the HIV virus were [found guilty and sentenced to death today in Tripoli](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/12/19/libya.aids.ap/index.html), despite international outcry and [molecular phylogenetic evidence demonstrating their innocence](/archives/2006/12/libya-vs-evolut.html).  As much as it is tempting to snarkily frame this as a court victory for anti-evolution forces, the situation is too serious.
