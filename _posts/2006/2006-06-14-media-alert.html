<p>We have some interesting events coming up on TV and radio: two interviews that pit the wise against outrageous fools.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tonight (Wednesday), Jay Leno is having two special guests on his show. Ann Coulter, who is plugging her new anti-evolution, anti-freethought, anti-thought book of hate, is going to be on, and most wonderfully, with her will be <a title="The Old Gray Mare is headed for the Glue Factory" href="http://www.reachm.com/amstreet/archives/2006/06/13/the-old-gray-mare-is-headed-for-the-glue-factory/">George Carlin</a>, of the famous irreverent irreligiousness and sharp, searing wit. Let's hope for fireworks.</li>
<li>Friday, at 3:15 ET, on NPR's Science Friday&hellip;it's <a title="The Intersection: NPR Science Friday Appearance; September Tour Events" href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/06/science_friday_september_tour.php">Chris Mooney</a>, author of <i>The Republican War on Science</i> and advocate of good science, will be paired up with Tom Bethell, author of <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science</i>, who most infamously said, "Darwin's theory, I believe, is on the verge of collapse&hellip;Natural selection was quietly abandoned, even by his most ardent supporters, some years ago."</li>
</ul>

<p>These could be great fun. Tune in!</p>
