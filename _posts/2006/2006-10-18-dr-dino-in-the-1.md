The Pensacola News-Journal is once again giving everyone a front-row seat to the trial of Kent Hovind, aka Dr. Dino, for tax fraud.  See:

[Evangelist's trial begins](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061018/NEWS01/610180337/1006)

> But rather than accepting his responsibility as an employer, Hovind hid behind terminology, Heldmeyer said.
> 
> He called his employees "volunteers," "missionaries" or "ministers," she said. Wages were referred to as "gifts" or "love offerings."

Love offerings?  That must look interesting on the tax forms.
