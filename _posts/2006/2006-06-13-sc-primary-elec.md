Today, June 13th, is primary day in South Carolina.  Most of the would-be Democratic nominees are running unopposed, but the Republican slate is packed full for a number of races.  

The race for state Superintendent of Education has no fewer than 5 candidates running for the Republican nomination.  The SCSE page has the [response](http://www.sc-scied.org/EE/index.php/scied/comments/education_candidates/) of each candidate during a recent debate to the question of what they thought about teaching "alternatives" to evolution.  Read the responses and see what you think.  The two front-runners in the race are supposedly Karen Floyd and Bob Staton, and the winner of the nomination will be heavily favored to win the general election.  You can read more about Floyd's opinion on teaching evolution [here](http://scpie.org/FeatureArticle.asp?ArticleID=17).  Staton is a bit harder to pin down.  Most agree that he doesn't feel strongly about the issue, and therefore his answers tend to be tactfully vague.

Also on the ballot today is Oscar Lovelace challenging incumbent Governor [Mark Sanford](/archives/2006/01/two-mosquitoes-1.html).  

There are three candidates running for Lt. Governor.  Incumbent AndrÃ© Bauer is being challenged by Mike Campbell and Henry Jordan.  The views on teaching evolution among the first two are not a matter of public record as far as I know, but Jordan has, shall we say, a rather [unsubtle opinion](http://www.charleston.net/stories/default_pf.aspx?newsID=84687).  He also has complementary views on [religious diversity](http://www.scpronet.com/point/9710/p03.html).         

Anway, if you are from South Carolina, please get out and vote.  There are obviously other issues to consider, so choose your candidates carefully.
