USA Today has a front-page [**article**](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm) on the impact of [**Flying Spaghetti Monsterism**](http://www.venganza.org/) (March 27th, 2006).  The article discusses Bobby Henderson's exciting new book, [**The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster**](http://www.venganza.org/gospel.htm).

I'm puzzled.  It seems the main output of Discovery's "robust scientific research program" has been books like Behe's "Darwin's Black Box," or Phillip Johnson's "Darwin on Trial."  So, by publishing a book about His Noodly Appendage, isn't Henderson performing research as robust as that of the Discovery Institute?
