Late this afternoon (Jan 10) the Ohio State Board of Education, by a 8-9 vote, defeated a motion to delete the offending "Critical Analysis" lesson plan from the model curriculum.  Two members were absent.

I described the situation earlier [on The Thumb](/archives/2006/01/call-for-action.html).

It now seems certain that it will take a lawsuit in federal court to pry it out of the state's model curriculum.  In fact, one ID-supporting board member said "Let them sue us".  I told the board in the public comments period after the vote that what it has done is create a "Dover trap" for every local school district in Ohio.  Already there are rumors that some creationist teachers are going beyond the ID-based lesson plan to "supplement" it with more blatantly creationist material, with the excuse that "the state board says it's OK".

I'll probably write more later and add links to news stories after I've had a drink or two and have calmed down.  The board's discussion of the motion this afternoon was as bitter and rancorous as I've ever seen, up to and including one of the two main ID-supporting Board Members, a former prosecutor, verbally abusing a graduate student who spoke during the public comments period.
