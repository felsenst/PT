<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/07/rainbow_and_lightning.php">A few weeks ago</a> I noted the fact that some Christians appear to detect design and divine control in the beauty of nature. For example, witnessing lightning and a rainbow simultaneously, one observer was driven to comment: "It reminded me that God is really in control." Now, it appears, Dembski is thinking the same way. He notes a photo "captured this week on the Idaho/Washington border" that shows a "fire rainbow" and comments that "[i]t's the gratuitousness of such beaty [<i>sic</i>] that leads me to rebel against materialism."

Over at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/08/fire_in_the_sky.php">Stranger Fruit</a>, I reply. You too can comment there.
