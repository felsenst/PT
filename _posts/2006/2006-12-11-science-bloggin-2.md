The [Science Blogging Conference](http://mistersugar.stikipad.com/blogtogether/show/HomePage) has been growing quickly.  It is now looking for its [100th registrant](http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/reports/science-blogging-conference-registration/).  [Will you be him or her](http://mistersugar.wufoo.com/forms/science-blogging-conference-registration/)?

Remember, if you come to the conference, Prof. Steve Steve will be on hand to drink you under the table like he drank down [Chris Mooney](http://www.scienceblogs.com/intersection/).

While you're at it, go vote of us again for the **[Best Science Blog of 2006](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_science_blog.php)**.  You can vote once every twenty-four hours.  Right now we are in a race with [In the Pipeline](http://www.corante.com/pipeline/) for third place.  Please don't let us lose to a the blog of a big-oil executive who wants to open-pit mine the Arctic Wildlife Refuge (or whatever [In the Pipeline](http://www.corante.com/pipeline/) is really about).
