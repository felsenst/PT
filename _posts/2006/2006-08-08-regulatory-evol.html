<p class="lead">I've been getting swamped with links to this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5245950.stm">hot article, "Evolution reversed in mice,"</a> including one from my brother (hi, Mike!). It really is excellent and provocative and interesting work from Tvrdik and Capecchi, but the news slant is simply weird&mdash;they didn't take "a mouse back in time," nor did they "reverse evolution." They restored the regulatory state of one of the Hox genes to a condition like that found half a billion years ago, and got a viable mouse; it gives us information about the specializations that occurred in these genes after their duplication early in chordate history. I am rather amused at the photos the news stories are all running of a mutant mouse, as if it has become a primeval creature. It's two similar genes out of a few tens of thousands, operating in a modern mammal! The ancestral state the authors are studying would have been present in a fish in the Cambrian.</p>

<p>I can see where what they've actually accomplished is difficult to explain to a readership that doesn't even know what the Hox genes are. I've written an <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/a_brief_overview_of_hox_genes.php">overview of Hox genes</a> previously, so if you want to bone up real quick, go ahead; otherwise, though, I'll summarize the basics and tell you what the experiment really did.</p>
