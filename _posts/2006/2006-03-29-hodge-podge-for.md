For once, I'm not the one writing the microbiology/evolution convergence stuff.  Over at [Mike the Mad Biologist](http://mikethemadbiologist.blogspot.com), check out his post discussing [Viruses, phylogeny, and Venezuela](http://mikethemadbiologist.blogspot.com/2006/03/viruses-phylogeny-and-venezuala-oh-my.html), discussing how phylogenetic analysis is used to track the evolution of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.  As Mike notes, "This study is a really good example of how biologists use evolution to understand structure and function."

On [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology), I have a discussion running about [certainty](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/03/certainty.php), and the "I know what I know; do not confuse me with the facts" mentality that many of you accustomed to dealing with IDers/creationists will recognize.
