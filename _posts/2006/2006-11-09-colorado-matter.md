As I [posted previously](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/10/cert.html), there is a new organization in Colorado called the Colorado Evolution Response Team, or [CERT](http://www.evolutionarygenomics.com/CERT/CERT.html).  James DiGregori, a founding member of CERT and a senior colleague of mine, was interviewed on NPR's [Colorado Matters](http://www.kcfr.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=94).  The direct link to the audio file is [here](http://www.kcfr.org/cgi-bin/comatters/comatters_play.asx?play=2882&amp;type=comatters.asx).  It's an excellent interview.

In other news, if anyone wants to know who won the South Carolina State Superintendent of Education race, tough potatoes.  We will [have to wait until at least next week](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/11/where-things-stand-with-sc-ssie-race.html) to get closure on that.  But the pro-science candidate currently has the lead, and that's encouraging.
