These two claims seem to be contradictory, so which one should we take as relevant? The one which claims that there exists a rigorous mathematical criterion which reliably (no false positives) detects design? Or the one which admits that there is the possibility of false positives, rendering the reliability criterion of this 'rigorous concept' invalid and making the concept of the [eliminative filter useless](/archives/2004/06/icons-of-id-exp.html)
