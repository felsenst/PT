Recent work has illuminated the evolution of the very anatomical feature that this site is named after.

TheJanuary 10, 2006 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS, vol. 103 | no. 2 | 379-382)
includes a paper titled "[Evidence of a false thumb in a fossil carnivore clarifies the evolution of pandas](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/2/379)" by Manuel J.Salesa,Mauricio AntÃ³n, StÃ©phane PeignÃ© and Jorge Morales.

It seems that the Panda's Thumb has evolved, not once, but twice!

The article says


> The "false thumb" of pandas is a carpal bone, the radial sesamoid, which has been enlarged and functions as an opposable thumb. If the giant panda (_Ailuropoda melanoleuca_) and the red panda (_Ailurus fulgens_) are not closely related, their sharing of this adaptation implies a remarkable convergence. The discovery of previously unknown postcranial remains of a Miocene red panda relative, _Simocyon batalleri_, from the Spanish site of Batallones-1 (Madrid), now shows that this animal had a false thumb. The radial sesamoid of _S. batalleri_ shows similarities with that of the red panda, which supports a sister-group relationship and indicates independent evolution in both pandas. The fossils from Batallones-1 reveal _S. batalleri_ as a puma-sized, semiarboreal carnivore with a moderately hypercarnivore diet. These data suggest that the false thumbs of _S. batalleri_ and _Ailurus fulgens_ were probably inherited from a primitive member of the red panda family (Ailuridae), which lacked the red panda's specializations for herbivory but shared its arboreal adaptations. Thus, it seems that, whereas the false thumb of the giant panda probably evolved for manipulating bamboo, the false thumbs of the red panda and of _S. batalleri_ more likely evolved as an aid for arboreal locomotion, with the red panda secondarily developing its ability for item manipulation and thus producing one of the most dramatic cases of convergence among vertebrates.

Is it a mere "coincidence" that one of the authors is a **StÃ©phane**?

Friends of Steve Steve, thou mayest now discuss.
