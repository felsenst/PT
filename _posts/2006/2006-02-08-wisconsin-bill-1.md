There is a bill in the Wisconsin state legislature that would ban the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in public school science classrooms there. I have a brief analysis available at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/02/antiid_legislation_in_wisconsi.php). 

**Update**: I've also got the full text of the bill, which reads as follows:

> **SECTION 1**. 118.018 of the statutes is created to read:
> 
> **118.018 Science instruction**. The school board shall ensure that any material presented as science within the school curriculum complies with all of the following:
> 
> **(1)** The material is testable as a scientific hypothesis and describes only natural processes.
> 
> **(2)** The material is consistent with any description or definition of science adopted by the National Academy of Sciences.
