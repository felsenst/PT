<p class="lead"><i>Darwin's Deadly Legacy</i>, the program that Coral Ridge Ministries is airing this weekend that supposedly links Hitler to Darwin, is beginning to look like a public relations catastrophe for the organization. First <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/hold_the_presses_collins_is_be.php">Francis Collins repudiated the show</a>, then the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/d_james_kennedy_busted.php">ADL put the hammer down</a>, and now another of the "featured guests" is distancing himself from the content. <a href="http://www.ooblick.com/weblog/2006/08/25/d-james-kennnedy-godwinates-behe-distances-himself-from-darwins-deadly-legacy/">Andrew Arensburger wrote to Michael Behe to find out about his contribution</a>, and got this reply:</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm "associated" with it only in the sense that a clip of my appearance 
on a TV show of Dr. Kennedy's from years ago apparently is used in the 
film. I didn't know this program was in the works, have had no 
conversations with anyone from Coral Ridge about it, and had no input 
into it.</p></blockquote>

<p>This looks more and more like a pastiche of generic creationist interviews slapped together to prop up a weak thesis.</p>
