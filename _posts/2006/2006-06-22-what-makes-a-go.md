For those of you who may be unfamiliar, over at [Scienceblogs.com](http://scienceblogs.com) they have a weekly feature:  [Ask a Scienceblogger.](http://scienceblogs.com/channel/ask/)  Previous questions have included topics as diverse as "brain drain" and the future of the human race (you can view the archives [here](http://scienceblogs.com/seed/scienceblogs/ask_a_scienceblogger/)).  This week's question is one that I thought might interest folks here, as I and others regularly write about science education (and how to improve it).  The question is (as noted in the title), "What makes a good science teacher?"  I have my thoughts up over at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/06/what_makes_a_good_science_teac.php), and you can find other musings posted at [this link](http://scienceblogs.com/channel/ask/) for the next week.
