Just wanted to call everyone's attention to a very engaging new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Altruism-Equation-Scientists-Origins-Goodness/dp/0691125902/sr=1-2/qid=1158692099/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-8955047-1217561?ie=UTF8&s=books"><i>The Altruism Equation: Seven Scientists Search for the Origins of Goodness,</i></a> by University of Louisville biologist Lee Alan Dugatkin.  Dugatkin traces the history of attempts to explain the evolutionary origin of altruistic behavior starting with Darwin, Huxley and Kropotkin and concluding with William Hamilton.  Actually, one small criticism of the book is that it's a bit unclear who the seven scientists are, since more then seven people receive serious discussion in the book.  This notwithstanding, it makes for a very enjoyable and informative read.  I've posted a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2006/09/the_altruism_equation.php">more detailed review</a> over at EvolutionBlog.  Comments may be left there.
