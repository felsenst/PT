<i>Skeptic</i> Magazine publisher Michael Shermer will be in Oakton, Virginia this Thursday, October 12,  to discuss his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Darwin-Matters-Against-Intelligent/dp/0805081216/sr=8-1/qid=1160518499/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3971780-5775209?ie=UTF8"><i>Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design</i></a>.  The talk is being cohosted by The Alliance for Science and the National Capitol Area Skeptics.  Regrettably, I will be unable to attend.  Having heard Shermer speak several times previously, I can say with some confidence that will be an interesting and informative talk.  If you're anywhere near Oakton, I strongly encourage you to attend.

The talk will be from 7:30-9:30, but Shermer will be signing copies of his book before the talk. <a href="http://www.math.jmu.edu/~rosenhjd/flyer.htm">Click here</a> for more information.
