Check out tonight's [InfidelGuy radio program](http://www.infidelguy.com/) (airs at 8PM EST) featuring Barbara Forrest.  

> Dr. Barbara Forrest, author of "Creationism's Trojan Horse" reappears on the program to discuss her thoughts about design, evolution, and the recent court case heard in Dover, Pennsylvania. Dr. Forrest provided key testimony at the trial herself, and we'll hear first hand how it all unfolded!
