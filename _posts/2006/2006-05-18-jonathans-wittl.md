DI flak Jonathan Witt has posted yet another attempt to undermine Judge Jones' ruling in _Kitzmiller_. It's as weak as the DI's previous 13,582,196 tries. I've written a full fisking of his post at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/05/jonathans_wittless_revisionism.php). Comments may be left there.
