Ask and yea shall receive.  A [kindly tech wizard](/archives/2006/11/neil-degrasse-t.html#comment-146029) _did_ stop by and post Neil deGrasse Tyson's lecture on YouTube ([part 1](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7WkGgmEoLkM), [part 2](http://youtube.com/watch?v=xpCCjd5rzVI)), so now you can watch it without any tedious downloading.  Virtually all of the lecture is there, the last few seconds seem to have been cut off.

The [original thread](/archives/2006/11/neil-degrasse-t.html) has become yet another holy war thread (my fault, I acknowledge), so I will focus here simply on why Tyson's lecture turned me into a fawning Tyson fanboy.  Highlights:

\* The potential importance of the humanities to a scientist (spaces _between_ the pumpkins).
\* The similarities between a religious pilgrimage to a mountaintop, and an astrophysicist's similar pilgrimage.
\* The real problem isn't the feeling of one's size in the universe, it's the prior size of one's ego.
\* "I don't so much care whether they abandon previous \[religious\] feelings. I've got an offering \[science\], that keeps going, that keeps getting more majestic."
