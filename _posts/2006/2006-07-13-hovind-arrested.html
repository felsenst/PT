<p>Kent Hovind's scofflaw habits are <a href="http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060713/NEWS01/60713013">catching up with him</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Pensacola evangelist was arrested Thursday and indicted in federal court on 58 charges that include income tax evasion, making threats against investigators and filing false complaints against Internal Revenue Service agents.</p></blockquote>

<p>Try not to snicker too loudly out there. It's not nice to laugh at the misfortunes of others.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I'm not a very nice person.</p>
