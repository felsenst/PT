[A recent press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/3/prweb358952.htm) underlines the growing controversy about Intelligent Design theory by announcing the release of two competing books exploring the theory that the universe is the product of intelligent design by a entity known as the "Flying Spaghetti Monster"

One book, [GOD SPEAKS! The Flying Spaghetti Monster in his Own Words](http://www.lulu.com/content/244704) by Jon Smith has been self published. The [preview](http://www.lulu.com/items/volume_13/244000/244704/9/preview/GOD_SPEAKS_2_PREVIEW.pdf) shows how the evidence strongly supports Intelligent Design. The author shows how anagrams such as "debit card - bad credit" can also be found in Genesis.

"In the beginning the Word was" becomes "Then God threw in a big new sin". The author continues to explore the new religion of Pastafarianism and its creation Theory that the world was created by the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Pastafarianism all started with a frustrated Bobby Henderson writing a letter to the Kansas Board of Education

> Let us remember that there are multiple theories of Intelligent Design. I and many others around the world are of the strong belief that the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster. It was He who created all that we see and all that we feel. We feel strongly that the overwhelming scientific evidence pointing towards evolutionary processes is nothing but a coincidence, put in place by Him. (www.venganza.org)

Some new beliefs and practices have emerged such as the observation that the correct ending to a prayer should be 'ramen' not 'amen' and FSM teachers need to be baptized by "holy meat sauce".

PandasThumb will be closely monitoring these shocking events, which show that the wedge is increasin in unexpected places.

Jon Smith is Dr. Jonathan C. Smith, a Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Professor of Psychology at Chicago's Roosevelt University, and Founding Director of the Roosevelt University Stress Institute. Dr. Smith has published 15 books and more than three dozen articles on stress, relaxation, and meditation.
