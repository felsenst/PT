Mims -- yes, _Mims_, the instigator of the whole fiasco about how noted ecology Eric Piana wants to kill everybody and the Texas Academy of Science agrees -- is now sending around vague threats to those in the Texas Academy of Sciences that dare speak up for the non-insanity of their own organization and their recent Scientist of the Year awardee.  [Pharyngula has put up the email](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/forrest_mims_a_wannabe_bully.php).

If anyone needed any more evidence that creationists are morbidly irony deficient, this is it.
