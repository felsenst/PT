Over at Red State Rabble, Pat Hayes, has [an interesting commentary](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2006/08/theological-deviations_22.html) on the Discovery Institute's reaction to the [apparent retirement](http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0604749.htm) of "intelligent design" creationism critic, Jesuit Father George V. Coyne, from the directorship of the Vatican Observatory.

> If Discovery, as the main think tank championing intelligent design, doesn't address metaphysical and religious questions then we have to ask: On what basis are they weighing in on theological questions such as Rev. Coyne's alleged support for "Process Theology?"
> 
> If intelligent design, as its proponents claim, can tell us nothing about the nature of God, then why is Bruce Chapman -- in his official capacity as Director and using Discovery's Evolution News and Views blog to deliver the message -- even addressing the question of whether or not "God is still learning and could not have known what his world was becoming."
> 
> And finally, if intelligent design is truly a scientific theory as claimed, what is the scientific proof that provides the evidentiary basis for making a determination about the truth or falsity of what God knows and what he doesn't.
