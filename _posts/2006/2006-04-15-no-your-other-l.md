Apparently seven of the world's 550 species of flounder are actually _polymorphic_ for which side of the juvenile becomes the new "top" side in the adult flatfish.  Apparently either eye can pop out and rotate to the new top.  This says some rather interesting things about the developmental processes involved.  

For more, go check out [the webpage describing the research](http://ceratostoma.bms.bc.ca/cbergstr/starry%20flounder%20info%20Page%208.htm) of famed flatfish researcher [Dr. Carolyn Bergstrom](http://ceratostoma.bms.bc.ca/cbergstr/) of [Bamfield Marine Science Centre](http://www.bms.bc.ca/) in Bamfield, British Columbia.
