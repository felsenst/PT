Actually, it's split into two posts, just as the original post by [Casey Luskin](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/07/john_derbyshires_new_bumper_st_1.html) was done in two parts. You can have a look at [my response to Luskin's attack on Judge Jones](http://austringer.net/wp/?p=348), and then continue with some [comments on Luskin's trashing of the TalkOrigins Archive](http://austringer.net/wp/?p=349). Basically, in the first I point out that Luskin's real problem is with ID advocate Michael Behe, not Judge Jones, since it was Behe's testimony that Jones relied upon to make the statements that Luskin finds objectionable. In the second, I take a look at the complete irrelevancies and odd reactions Luskin has to the TalkOrigins Archive article cited by John Derbyshire. Enjoy!
