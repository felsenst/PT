<p>Sometimes a plan just comes together beautifully. I'm flying off to London tomorrow, and on the day I get back to Morris, I'm supposed to lead a class discussion on the final chapters of this book we've been reading, <i>Endless Forms Most Beautiful</i>. I will at that point have a skull full of jet-lagged, exhausted mush, and I just know it's going to be a painful struggle. Now into my lap falls a wonderful gift.</p>

<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18970">review in the NY Review of Books</a> that said wonderful things about Carroll's work, and in particular about the revolutionary nature of evo-devo. This prompted Jason Hodin, an evo-devo researcher himself (whose <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/evolution_of_hormone_signaling.php">work I've mentioned before</a>) to write a rebuttal and send it off to NYRB&hellip;which they chose not to publish. So he sent it to me, with permission to post it.</p>

<p>(If Pharyngula is going to be second choice to the NY Review of Books, I'm not going to complain.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm almost as guilty as Carroll of hawking the wares of the evo-devo bandwagon and traveling roadshow, so this is a welcome balancing corrective. The complete text is below the fold.</p>
