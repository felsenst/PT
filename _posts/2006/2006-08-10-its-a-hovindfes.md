Today appears to be Hovind-Fest at Dispatches from the Culture Wars. I have two posts there that might be of interest to creationist watchers here at the Panda's Thumb. The [first post](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/08/guest_post_i_remember_hovey_1.php) is a guest post from Skip Evans that recalls his long history of interaction with the world's looniest creationist, along with some reminiscing from me as well. The [second post](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/08/bad_news_for_hovind.php) contains information on a court ruling in Washington that doesn't bode well for Hovind's arguments in court in Florida. A fellow whacko from the Embassy of Heaven church, represented by Glen Stoll, the same attorney that has represented Hovind before, tried to make the same claims Hovind does - the court has no jurisdiction, he's employed by God, he has no income, etc - as a way of getting out of paying child support. The court smacked down that argument hard.
