According to the [_Pensacola News-Journal_ story](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061030/NEWS01/61029007/1006), the Hovind tax evasion trial was delayed last week because his attorney, Jerry Barringer, was ill.  See also [this earlier story](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061024/NEWS01/61024002).

> Hovind and his wife, Jo, are accused of tax evasion, including failure to pay $473,818 in employee-related taxes at his Creation Science Evangelism Ministry, which inlcudes Dinosaur Adventure Land on North Palafox Street.
> 
> Hovind, a tax protester, makes a substantial amount of money. But he believes he and his employees work for God, are paid by God and, therefore, aren't subject to taxation.
> 
> Schneider testified this morning that Jo Hovind requested financial help for her bills from Baptist Health Care, claiming that she had no income.
> 
> Schneider also said the Hovinds wrote checks to their children from their Christian Science Evangelism account. They also withdrew money from that account for cashier's checks.
> 
> On one day, a $9,000 check was withdrawn for their son, Eric. That same day, another $9,000 check was withdrawn for Eric's wife, Tanya.
> 
> Schneider said Kent Hovind refused to give a tax identification number to the First Baptist Church of Satsuma in Alabama, where he spoke. The church paid him a $738 fee. The tax ID number would have been used on a tax-reporting form.
