<p class="lead">In my <a href="/archives/2006/08/the-politically-3.html">review of the embryology of Jonathan Wells in PIGDIG</a>, I made a specific example of the abuse of a quote from Bill Ballard; I pointed out that he selectively edited the quote to completely distort Ballard's point in the cited paper, and used that to show how dishonest all of Wells' work was.</p>

I didn't just selectively edit, he thinks I actively <i>changed Wells' words to make my point</i>.</p>

And not a single commentator on Panda's Thumb for the past two months could be bothered to check Myers's quotation against Wells's actual words to see whether Myers was telling the truth.</p></blockquote>
