A few people had nudged me to mention this on here, but I keep forgetting.  I started a new blog carnival a few months back (I know, I know, like we need more of those...)  [This one is devoted to all things microbial](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/02/announcing_new_blog_carnival_1.php), and the current edition is up today over at [Discovering Biology in a Digital World.](http://digitalbio.blogspot.com/2006/05/animalcules-volume-1-issue-7.html)  It's still puny compared to a monster like [Tangled Bank](http://tangledbank.net/), but a nice one-stop-shop for some interesting microbiology posts.
