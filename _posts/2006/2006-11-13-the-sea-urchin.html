<p class="lead">Oh happy day, the <a href="http://sugp.caltech.edu/">Sea Urchin Genome Project</a> has reached fruition with the publication of the full sequence in last week's issue of <i>Science</i>. This news has been all over the web, I know, so I'm late in getting my two cents in, but hey, I had a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/11/a_summary_of_the_mncse_science.php">busy weekend</a>, and and I had to spend a fair amount of time actually reading the papers. They didn't just publish one mega-paper, but they had a whole section on <i>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</i>, with a genomics mega-paper and articles on ecology and paleogenomics and the immune system and the transcriptome, and even a big <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/314/5801/938a.pdf">poster of highlights of sea urchin research</a> (but strangely, very little on echinoderm development). It was a good soaking in echinodermiana.</p>
