That might sound a bit strange--doesn't have quite the ring to it as [Chris's book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465046754/102-4227667-0152131?v=glance&amp;n=283155).  But, never fear, epidemiology is indeed under attack--or, at least, it's being redefined by young earth creationists.  

In a pair of articles published in the esteemed journal, [Creation Research Society Quarterly](http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq.html), Jeffrey Schragin has put forth his argument that "the Bible's epidemiology is scientifically sound" and that the "Creation Health Model (CHM) offers a more comprehensive understanding of health and disease than standard molecules-to-man evolutionary theory."
