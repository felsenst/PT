I will demonstrate in this paper that all the Indo-European languages and probably all languages on earth evolved from ancient Hebrew.

The conventional wisdom is that Hebrew and the languages of Europe share only three words: _amen_, _hallelu-Yah_, and _Kokah-Kolah_. The 3000-year-old manuscripts known as the Dead Ashkenaz Scrolls, however, contain ancient Hebrew roots so old that they are not found in the Hebrew Bible: they survive only in Yiddish. This discovery dispels the usual belief that Yiddish is a Germanic language; rather, the manuscripts show that German is a Yiddic language.

Many of the newly discovered roots are familiar to speakers of Yiddish and natives of the New York metropolitan area. For example, the root _shlep_ means to bear a heavy load, as in the sentence, "Ani shilafti mishpachti le-'Ir ha-Strassim; I carted my family to Strasbourg." The Strassim were an early group of city dwellers and probably invented the street.

On the way to 'Ir ha-Strassim, the ancient Ashkenazit had to amuse her children with a _tsatskeh_. Often, when a _tsatskeh_ fell apart after a few minutes of use, the Ashkenazit complained that it was a piece of _shlock_.

The root _shmuz_ belongs to an irregular conjugation or one that has been lost. It means to chat amiably, as in "Hu shmuz 'im El-Sah ba-gan; he is chatting with Elsa in the garden." A root with a similar meaning, _kibits_, survives in modern Hebrew in the word kibbutz and the verb, to gather. The original meaning, however, was to watch a game and make comments: "Hee kibtsah shachmat; she was kibitzing a game of chess." 

When an ancient Ashkenazic Jew prayed fervently, he used the root, _daven_.  This root is the origin of the English word divine and the Latin, deus. The ancient Ashkenazi _bentshed_, or prayed after his meals. The Latin word benedicere, to bless, derives from _bentsh_.  To eat between meals was represented by a separate root, _nosh_, and you generally did not have to _bentsh_ after a _nosh_. 

To swell with pride was represented by the root, _kvell_: "Sabah kivel be-bar hamitsvah; Grandfather swelled with pride at the bar-mitzvah boy." Afterward, Grandfather sometimes became crotchety, and a closely related root developed: _kvetsh_. 

To work very hard was to _shvits_: "Ani shvitsti kol ha-yom; I worked hard all day." If you labored hard in hot weather, you perspired a lot, so the verb eventually took on a slightly different meaning. Not everyone worked hard, even in those days, however; those who begged for a living were said to _shnorr_, and they could make quite a _tsimmes_ if you didn't give them some food or a little _gelt_.

In principle, all Hebrew words are derived from one of a thousand or so three-letter roots. These roots in turn derive from a smaller number of two-letter roots; for example, _kvell_ (K-V-L) and _kvetsh_ (K-V-Tsh) probably derive from the two-letter root K-V, to show emotion. In a later paper, I will show that Hebrew itself was not given by G-d but rather evolved from a single one-letter root, V, most likely a primal scream, "Vaaaaaayyyyyy!"

**About the author**.  The author can conjugate Hebrew, even if he can't speak it.

**Glossary**.

**Note**.  Yiddish is not German, so I have transliterated _sh_ as _sh_, not _sch_.  When Germans recognize the Yiddic roots of their language, they will drop the _c_.
