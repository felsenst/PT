I started writing a little something on my blog mentioning [Ed's critique](/archives/2006/10/dis-claims-on-i.html) of the latest DI "we've blown 4 million with nothing to show for it" spin.  I was just going to link to it and then make one little tiny extra point, but before I knew it, it had balooned into a long-winded essay.  So I thought I'd share it with a broader audience.

[ How to Waste Four Million Bucks](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/10/how-to-waste-four-million-bucks.html)

Enjoy!
