One of the better posts mentioned in yesterday's Tangled Bank can be found over at Adventures in Science and Ethics. In that article, Janet [provides a clear and detailed explanation](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/03/the_areas_of_my_expertise.php) of the limits of scientific expertise. As she reminds us, scientists are not near-omniscient beings, endowed with some sort of infailable ability to assess ideas across all the fields of scientific research. Scientists are primarily qualified to comment on matters within their own field. If a scientist is not an expert in an area of science, he or she should give the scientists within the other field the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they have a better understanding of their own area. As Janet points out, scientists (and other adademics) should be responsible enough to know their own limitations.

This sense of responsibility seems to be somewhat lacking among some of the more prominant proponents of Intelligent Design. It's shown up in [any number of places](http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2006/02/informed-dissent.html), including [a recent article](http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2690.htm) by well-known philosopher Alvin Plantinga.
