Seems that noone has informed Logan Gage of his erroneous interpretations of Darwinian theory, the concept of randomness and the meaning of purpose. In a followup posting Gage [argues](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/11/random_mutation_generator.html#more)

In addition to failing to comprehend the concept of randomness, Gage now seems to confuse random mutation with 'the Darwinian process'. Has noone informed him that the Darwinian process consists of two components?  In fact, mutations were not even known in Darwin's days, thus Darwin speaks of variation and selection.

In addition, he also seems to mangle Dawkins' Weasel example, which seems a common affliction amongst creationists.

In other news, David Opderdeck explores the flawed logic in [Logan Gage's](http://www.davidopderbeck.com/archives/2006/11/intelligent_des_2.html) position and argues that Gage's position "was unfair, and reflects a serious theological problem with some "strong" ID arguments."

Is there anything redeeming to Intelligent Design?
