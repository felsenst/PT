<p class="lead">Five days ago, I wrote about <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/11/nature_publishes_a_crank_lette.php">a creationist letter that was published in <i>Nature</i></a>. At that time, there was a discussion going on in email with the gang at the Panda's Thumb, and someone said we ought to get a pool going on how long it would take before the Intelligent Design creationists would use this to argue that their case was being seriously discussed in the pages of a major scientific journal. Four months was suggested; I said one week.</p>

<p>I should have put some money down on that.</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>It turns out one of the PhD alumni in biology from Moran's school (University of Toronto), <b>a respected scientist and pro-ID creationist recently had his letter published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature. This is news in itself that creationists and ID proponents are getting airtime now in scientific journals</b>&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>That was the unctuous clown, <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1797">Sal Cordova</a>, of course. It was four days before they were trumpeting this crank letter as a triumph for Intelligent Design creationism.</p>
