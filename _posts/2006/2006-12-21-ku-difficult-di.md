The University of Kansas Hall Center for the Humanities has [put online the videos from this fall's "Difficult Dialogs" series](http://www.hallcenter.ku.edu/~hallcenter/video/).  Included are talks by Ken Miller, Judge Jones, Richard Dawkins, Eugenie Scott, and Michael Behe.  We had some previous discussion of the Behe talk [here](/archives/2006/12/behe-reveals-th.html). (Apparently Behe was the ID guy who "discovered" that lawyers file a lot of paper with the court before, during, and after a trial, including Proposed Findings of Fact, which of course would be obvious if one had looked at the [_Kitzmiller_ documents archive](http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/) that NCSE has maintained since the trial began.)
