Jack Krebs, president of Kansas Citizens for Science, gave a talk on "What's the matter with the Standards" at Johnson County Community College this past Monday. Jack has kindly made the audio available as a set of MP3 format files. Jack's original post on this is [here](http://www.kcfs.org/kcfsnews/?p=164).
