One of the contributors on the "Uncommon Descent" weblog, "BarryA", has joined the ranks of intelligent design advocates who want in on Monday-morning quarterbacking the _Kitzmiller v. DASD_ case. "BarryA" wrote that Judge Jones was incompetent in permitting Eric Rothschild to present defense expert Michael Behe with a stack of papers and textbooks about the evolution of the immune system, one of those systems that Behe calls "irreducibly complex". Behe had said this about it, ""We can look high or we can look low in books or in journals, but the result is the same. The scientific literature has no answers to the question of the origin of the immune system." Rothschild wanted to go into how many papers and how much work was out in the literature. ID advocates have become fond of calling the practice of showing up their essential cluelessness by reference to the scientific literature as "literature bluffing". The only bluff around that point in the KvD trial, though, was Behe's.
