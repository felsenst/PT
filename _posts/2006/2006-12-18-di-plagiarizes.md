It seems that the Discovery Institute, while disingenuously libeling a Federal judge for his routine use of findings of fact from a plaintiffs' brief, has been engaged in plagiarism of its own work in a context where such copying is strictly forbidden. Virtually every law review has strict rules against publishing articles that substantially copy one's own previously published works, yet the DI's David DeWolf and Casey Luskin submitted an article to the Montana Law Review that was 95% identical to what they had written in the book _Traipsing Into Evolution_. Prof. Peter Irons has issued a press release concerning this, which is available at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/study_shows_discovery_institut.php). Comments may be left there.
