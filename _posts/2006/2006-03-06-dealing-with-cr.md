A parent recently contacted Colorado Citizens for Science, saying that his fourth grader at a public school had brought home a DVD promoting intelligent-design creationism as an alternative to evolution.  CCFS advised the parent to contact the teacher before approaching the administration, and also recommended that he read the relevant resources on the Website of the National Center for Science Education and bone up on Judge Jones's decision in _Kitzmiller_.  

Additionally, a CCFS Board member described her own, similar experience, as well as forwarded to the parent her correspodence with her child's teacher.  The Board member's case was not resolved successfully until she approached the school board and, ultimately, threatened to file a lawsuit.  CCFS has posted its reply to the parent and also the CCFS Board member's correspondence with the teacher at [this](http://www.coloradocfs.org/CaseStudy.pdf) URL.

We do not yet know how the parent's case will come out.
