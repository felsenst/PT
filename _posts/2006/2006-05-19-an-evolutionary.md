This may be a little "old hat" for many of you.  After all, how many ways can I find to say, "Don't try to get science from your Bible"?  But with that risk let me direct you to _An Evolutionary View of Kinds_ on [Threads from Henry's Web](http://www.energionpubs.com/wordpress/?p=196).  Leave your comments there.  This article is the result of reading some of Alvin Plantinga's work on theistic science, a concept I find pretty dangerous.
