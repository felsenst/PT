<p>Talk.origins' resident curmudgeon and contributor of a number of FAQs in the archives, Larry Moran, has <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/">a new blog, the Sandwalk</a>. Interestingly, it seems to have been discovered first by Billy Dembski and Denyse O'Leary, who made a sneering post on it at Uncommon Descent&hellip;which means that the comments are filled with the fulminations of the usual creationist suspects. Think about that; they've crept out of the shelter of their heavily censored sanctuary and are out in force at a blog that won't edit and delete and modify your comments. If you want to engage Intelligent Design creationists directly, it's a happy hunting ground!</p>

<p>Oh, yeah&hellip;and Moran himself has also put up quite a collection of articles, all in his inimitably opinionated style, so I'm sure the raconteurs of the Panda's Thumb will find much to argue about <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/">over there</a>.</p>
