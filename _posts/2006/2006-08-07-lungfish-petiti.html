<p class="lead">There is now an <a title="A Very Special Fish %u2013 Australian Lungfish under Threat Petition" href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/610807318">online petition to save the Australian Lungfish</a> (you can read more about the threatened lungfish <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/the_neoceratodus_campaign.php">here</a>, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/help_the_australian_lungfish.php">here</a>, and <a href="http://joshrlarsen.googlepages.com/">here</a>). Take a moment and put your name on it!</p>

<p>Also, it's not just the lungfish&mdash;as Monika Dieker reminded me, there's also the <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news73922975.html">Mary River Turtle</a> at risk.</p>
