> - Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned medical school graduates Thursday that centuries of progress in scientific research are under attack by those who oppose stem cell research and dispute evolution and global warming.


[Bloomberg: Science under attack in stem cell research debate](http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--bloomberg-whichpa0525may25,0,7765594.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork) by SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer

On the topic of Intelligent Design, the republican mayor wasted no words 

> He then ridiculed the campaign to teach schoolchildren about "intelligent design" alongside evolution. The belief proposes that living organisms are so complex that they must have been created by some type of higher force, and many conservatives, including Bush, say schools should present both concepts.
> 
> The mayor said children who learn it are receiving an inferior education that puts them at a disadvantage later.
> 
> He told the medical students that they share the same burden carried by the school's first graduates more than 100 years ago, when the field was "dominated by quacks and poorly trained physicians."
> 
> Their task, Bloomberg said, is to "defend the integrity and power of science."
