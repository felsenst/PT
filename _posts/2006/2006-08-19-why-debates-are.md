In the evolution/creationism controversy, there is a sub-debate about public debates: should scientists and science fans engage in oral public debates with creationists?  Sometimes it is said that the answer is always "no" -- debates are sport, not serious discussion, and creationists can employ the "Gish Gallop" to rattle off hundreds of bogus claims, each of which would take minutes or hours to debunk in the fashion done on talk.origins.  But the real answer is "it depends", because there are circumstances when it is appropriate -- neutral forums, a setup that allows individual topics to be discussed in depth, you are an expert debater like Kenneth Miller, etc.  On the other hand, if you are being invited to a debate set up by creationists for the purpose of promoting creationism, with their rules, press, etc., and their audience bussed in from fundamentalist churches, and when they are planning to record, broadcast, and sell recordings of the event to promote creationism/ID -- then you should think twice about whether or not you are being "set up," and whether or not your participation is helping or hurting the cause of science education.

Here is another situation in which you should think twice.  On the web, I just stumbled on [this announcement](http://www.bayword.com/calendarinfo.asp?Id=25913) of a series of upcoming ID events in Florida, called "Darwin of Design?"  See the line I bolded:

It looks like the promoters accidentally sent out the _draft_ announcement, and then at least one recipient, WTBN, "Tampa Bay's Christian Talk" radio station put it up without reading it.  I haven't looked for other instances posted at church websites etc., but they may exist.

Anyhoo, if the announcement for the creationism/ID debate, _before you are even signed up_, describes you as "Dr. Donald Duh, professor (emeritus) at Whatever State University", then maybe, just maybe, this is a debate you should refrain from participating in.
