As I explained in my last post, the SC Board of Education met today to vote on the "critically analyze" (read: teach erroneous ID arguments) language that the Educational Oversight Committee wanted added.  The BOE voted down the measure by a margin of 10-6 or 11-6, depending on whether or not you count the Chairman, whose vote apparently doesn't count in the official tally (but being the cool guy he is, he wanted to make it clear where he stood).

Here's the article from the AP:  [S.C. Schools Won't 'Analyze' Evolution.](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=1701180)

From what I hear, there were some excellent speakers who spoke out against the EOC proposal.  They deserve major credit for this.  Also, here's a list of who voted for and against the proposal:

_Voted to reject the EOC proposal_: Woodall, Tindal, Burch, DuBard, Forrester, Mitchell, Pye, Sumter, Simpson, V. Wilson.

_Voted support the EOC proposal_: Curtis, Maguire, McKinny, Seckinger, Shoopman, R. Wilson.

If you are from SC, feel free to drop a letter of thanks to those board members who voted against the proposal.  It's important that they know they have support.  And if you _must_ send a missive to one of those who voted in favor of the proposal, please note that a) it won't do you any good, and b) if you are anything other than super-polite, they will complain that they're being persecuted.  (Fair's allies in the EOC have already made a habit of doing this.)

Rep. Bob Walker kicked things off this morning by presenting [a petition](http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/14043923.htm) in favor of the "critically analyze" language signed by 67 of 123 General Assembly members, and warned angrily that he's going to take this in front of the legislature.  Walker is probably the biggest ally of Sen. Mike Fair (who I hear appeared "discernibly turgid" after hearing the vote tally) in trying to get the pro-ID language added to the curriculum standards.  Walker previously sent a [letter (pdf)](http://www.thestateonline.com/news/pdfs/060308-walker-letter.pdf) to the BOE explaining, among other things, that it was "unanimous" that the evidence for evolution had been fabricated.  

While I suspect that a significant portion of those legislators who signed that petition didn't know what they were signing, one way or another this is going to head to the State House floor.  The Discovery Institute is going to have a lot of fun trying to keep 67 table-pounders from spilling the beans and admitting that this is all about the Bible and Jesus.  Walker has already [done that himself](http://www.charleston.net/stories/?newsID=66956&amp;section=localnews).  Careful what you wish for guys.
