Over at [Immunoblogging,](http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com) Joseph has a multi-post series on the evolution of the immune system that I've been meaning to highlight, since obviously the claim that there's no research done in this area plays a large part in IDists' claims.  So, some background reading on a few of the issues:  

[Part One](http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/02/evolution-of-immune-system-mhc-part-i.html)
[Part Two](http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/02/evolution-of-immune-system-mhc-part-ii.html)
[Part Three](http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/02/evolution-of-immune-system-mhc-part.html)
and a bonus (if a bit older) post on Toll-like receptors [here](http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2005/06/toll-like-receptors-and-you.html), along with a newer overview [here.](http://immunoblogging.blogspot.com/2006/03/creationists-love-immune-system.html)

Additionally, at the new [Good Math, Bad Math](http://goodmath.blogspot.com/), MarkCC discusses [Dembski's (mis)use of the NFL theorem](http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/03/king-of-bad-math-dembskis-bad.html) and [creationist use of probability.](http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/03/studying-bad-probability-creation_14.html)   Check 'em out.
