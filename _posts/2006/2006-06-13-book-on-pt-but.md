The review speaks of "the PT boundary" and "the PT mass extinction", but, sadly for creationists, it is speaking not of the Panda's Thumb, but the Permian-Triassic boundary.  The PT mass extinction is the largest and most severe mass extinction recorded in the fossil record, and (unlike the KT boundary, due to a bolide impact), scientists have not reached consensus on what the the primary cause(s) were.  

Erwin's book is entitled _Extinction: How Life Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago_.  Check out the [review](http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/06/extinction.php) and the [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691005249/).
