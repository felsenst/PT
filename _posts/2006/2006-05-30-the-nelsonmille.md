For those interested in the Paul Nelson/Keith Miller situation, Dr. Nelson has responded to my accusations on my blog and I have answered them. He seems to believe, falsely, that he did not misrepresent MIller's views, yet he says he's now going to apologize anyway. Disingenuous apologies are no more interesting than disingenuous arguments. I think he knows he's caught, but simply can't admit it. For more information, see the [follow up post](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/05/paul_nelsons_continued_lie.php) at Dispatches from the Culture Wars. Comments may be left there.
