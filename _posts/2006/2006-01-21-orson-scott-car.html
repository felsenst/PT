<p><a href="http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2006-01-08-1.html">Orson Scott Card has written a long essay defending Intelligent Design</a>.</p>

<p>Oy, but it is depressing.</p>

<p>It's a graceless hash, a cluttered and confusing mish-mash of poorly organized complaints about those darned wicked "Darwinists". He lists 7 arguments. Then he repeats his list, expanding on them. Then he goes on and on, hectoring scientists about how they should behave. For a professional writer, it's just plain bad writing&mdash;I'm struggling with how to address his arguments, but he's written such a gluey mass of tangled ranty irrationality that it's hard to get a handle on it. Ugly, ugly, ugly&hellip;and why do these guys all seem to think the way to defend the ideas of ID is to whine about the perfidy of all those scientists? Not once does he bring up any evidence for ID.</p>

<p>Card can't discuss the evidence, because he doesn't know or understand the evidence. That's apparent when he begins by praising Behe's <i>Darwin's Black Box</i>, and regurgitates the argument from irreducible complexity. <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/hang_your_head_in_shame_grauniad/">Irreducible complexity is not a problem for evolution</a>, and <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/behe_at_the_maclaurin_institute/">Behe is a tired old fraud who hasn't had a new idea in 15 years</a>. That Card would be impressed with <i>DBB</i> says only that he doesn't know much biology and that the depth of his thinking is remarkably shallow.</p>

<p>Oh, well. I'll try the brute force approach and discuss each of Card's arguments in turn. This will get long.</p>
