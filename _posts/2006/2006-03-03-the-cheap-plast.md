Did you know that there really is a scientific controversy over evolution?  If you didn't, it's because you haven't been reading the _internets_.  Just do a Google search and you'll see "Intelligent Design" crop up all over the place, proof positive that there really is a controversy. 

You can learn about this and other astounding bits of wisdom from SC Educational Oversight Committee member (and disposable products magnate) Karen Iacovelli, on [my new blog](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/03/eoc-member-who-hates-public-education.html).  Incidentally, Iacovelli is an odd choice for EOC appointee, given that she doesn't think that public education should even exist.
