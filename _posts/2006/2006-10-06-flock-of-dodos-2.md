Since _Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus_ has now found a distributor, [Documentary Educational Resources](http://www.der.org/films/flock-of-dodos.html), institutions, like libraries and universities, can now buy a copy for $345, which includes public performance rights.

I have [asked](http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2006/10/flock_of_dodos.html) the NCSU Library to acquire a copy, which [they've agreed to do](http://dererumnatura.us/archives/2006/10/woohoo.html).  ([Coturnix](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/flock_of_dodos.php) did so as well.)

When the DVD comes in, the library is going to hold it for me.  When I get it, I plan on having a screening, putting those public performance rights to good use.  I still have to work out the details, but if you are in the research-triangle area and want information regarding the showing, post a comment with your contact email address.  Whenever the details get worked out, I'll drop y'all a line.
