Someone [didn't get the DI memo](http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/163336/) in Arkansas:

> One of the assembly's officers, former state lawmaker Gunner DeLay of Fort Smith, is the Republican candidate for attorney general.
> 
> DeLay said he wrote a paper in law school on what he says is a teacher's "right to academic freedom" under the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution to teach subjects that are "scientifically valid."
> 
> He said that could include intelligent design.
> 
> "The basis of my paper was that although legislative mandated efforts to teach creation science or intelligent design have been struck down, the courts have left open teaching those theories under an instructor's First Amendment right to academic freedom," DeLay said.
> 
> Such protected speech would have to have a "scientific basis," DeLay said, adding that a science teacher "could not come in and say we're all born under a cabbage leaf."
> 
> "The old creation science is the new intelligent design. And yes, I think it's scientifically valid," DeLay said.
