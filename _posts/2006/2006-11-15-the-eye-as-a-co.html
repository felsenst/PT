<p class="lead">Ian Musgrave has just posted an excellent article on the <a href="/archives/2006/11/denton-vs-squid.html">poor design of the vertebrate eye compared to the cephalopod eye</a>; it's very thorough, and explains how the clumsy organization of the eye clearly indicates that it is the product of an evolutionary process rather than of any kind of intelligent design. A while back, Russ Fernald of Stanford University published a fine review of eye evolution that summarizes another part of the evolution argument: it's not just that the eye has awkward 'design' features that are best explained by contingent and developmental processes, but that the diversity of eyes found in the animal kingdom <i>share</i> deep elements that link them together as the product of common descent. If all we had to go on was suboptimal design, one could argue for an Incompetent Designer who slapped together various eyes in different ways as an exercise in whimsy (strangely enough, though, this is not the kind of designer IDists want to propose)&hellip;but the diversity we do see reveals a notable <i>historical pattern</i> of constraint.</p>
