<p class="lead">I've now read all of the science-related (that's applying the term "related" very generously) stuff in Ann Coulter's awful, ghastly, ignorant book, <i>Godless</i>, and it's a bit overwhelming. This far right-wing political pundit with no knowledge of science at all has written a lengthy tract that is wall-to-wall error: To cover it all would require a sentence-by-sentence dissection that would generate another book, ten times longer than Coulter's, all merely to point out that her book is pure garbage. So I'm stumped. I'm not interested in writing such a lengthy rebuttal, and I'm sure this is exactly what Coulter is counting on&mdash;tell enough lazy lies, and no one in the world will have time enough to correct them conscientiously. She's a shameless fraud.</p>

<p>What to do? Well, we can't take apart the whole thing, but what we can do is focus on individual claims and show that Coulter is outrageously wrong&mdash;that she has written things that indicate an utter lack of knowledge of the subject. Some of us at the <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/">Panda's Thumb</a> are going to be doing just that&mdash;look there later for more&mdash;and what I'm going to do here is address one very broad claim that Coulter has made repeatedly, and that is also common to many creationists.</p>

<p>That claim is that there is no evidence for evolution. I know, to anybody who has even a passing acquaintance with biology, that sounds like a ridiculous statement, like declaring that <a href="http://www.breatharian.com/breatharianism2.htm">people can live on nothing but air and sunlight</a>, or that <a href="http://www.thothweb.com/content-163.html">yeti are transdimensional UFO pilots</a>. Yet Coulter baldly makes the absurd <a href="http://cosmicafterthoughts.blogspot.com/2006/06/ann-coulter-on-evolution.html">claim</a> that "There's no physical evidence for [evolution]", and insists in chapter 8 of her new book that there is "no proof in the scientist's laboratory or the fossil record." This is like standing outside in a drenching rainstorm and declaring that there is no evidence that you are getting wet.</p>
