Eric Rothschild, lead attorney for the plaintiffs in _Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, et al._ and Tammy Kitzmiller, the lead plaintiff, will speak in Columbus, Ohio, on February 12.

Rothschild, a partner in the Philadelphia office of Pepper Hamilton LLP, will speak on "An Inside Look at the Dover Intelligent Design Case and What it Means for Ohio."  Kitzmiller will describe her experiences as lead plaintiff in the case.

In addition to Rothschild and Kitzmiller, Dr. Hillel Chiel, Professor of Biology, Neurosciences, and Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, will speak on  "Religion vs Evolution: An Unnecessary Struggle for Survival".  Dr. Chiel, an orthodox Jew, studies brain-behavior relationships as they affect survival and reproductive success in biological populations.

Rothschild, Kitzmiller and Chiel will speak at Congregation Tifereth Israel, 1354 East Broad Street in Columbus, at 3:00 pm on Sunday, February 12.  The event is free and open to the public.  A reception will follow the talks.

The event is sponsored by [Ohio Citizens for Science](http://www.ohioscience.org).

Judge John E. Jones III, who heard the _Kitzmiller v. Dover_ case in Federal Court in Harrisburg, PA, found that intelligent design is no more than traditional creationism with a new name, and thus is unconstitutional to teach in public schools.  [Judge Jones' decision](http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf), a model of judicial clarity, described a number of points that have direct parallels in the actions of the Ohio State Board of Education over the last three years.  As I put it in the Columbus Dispatch, "The State Board of Education's retention of the intelligent-design based model lesson plan has set a "Dover trap" for every school district in Ohio" (Letter, Jan 27, 2006).
