[ How women evolved blond hair to win cavemen's hearts](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article348012.ece)

> Academic researchers have discovered that women in northern Europe evolved with light hair and blue eyes at the end of the Ice Age to stand out from the crowd and lure men away from the far more common brunette.

First, I'll note that I've not read the paper this article is based on, nor is it my intent to critique it.  It may be great, it may be terrible.  They may have a point, they may not.  \[Edited to add:  you can find a [post here](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/02/birth-of-blonde.php) on the actual paper for those interested\]. In this case, I'm concerned with the write-up, 'cause it's one of my pet peeves.   

"...women in N. Europe evolved with light hair...to lure men away from brunettes."   Couple this with the headline, and can't you just see these primitive Europeans, standing around in their animal skin clothing and discussing the issue?
