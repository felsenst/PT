Salient quote:

> While the Discovery Institute's opposition to Dover's curriculum policy has been widely reported, Buckingham said at first Cooper was enthusiastic and supportive. Cooper offered to send him materials about intelligent design.
> 
> "He'd call me to see if we were going to go forward," Buckingham said.
> 
> But gradually, as the publicity continued, the attorney began to suggest that the board should not move forward on the curriculum change because it could lead to a lawsuit.
> 
> "He was afraid we were going to lose the case," Buckingham said. "And he thought, if we did lose the case, it was going to set intelligent design back for years.
> 
> "He just didn't think we were the proper people to be pushing this at this time," Buckingham said.
> 
> The day after the school board voted in October 2004 to include intelligent design in its biology curriculum, Discovery Institute posted a news release saying it didn't support the school board.
> 
> "I think they thought we jumped their gun, so to speak," Buckingham said.
