Casey Luskin, over at the Discovery Institute's Center for ~~the Renewal of~~ Science and Culture, [has taken the time to redefine creationism](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/06/science_editorializes_over_dis_1.html) for us:

> Despite Holden's editorializing, ID is not creationism because creationism always postulates a supernatural creator, and/or is focused on proving some religious scripture. But intelligent design does neither.

I'd like to thank Mr. Luskin for taking the time to clarify that point. I'll try to remember to keep in mind the non-religious nature of the Discovery Institute in the future. 

Oh, and by the way, Casey, whatever happened to that old logo you folks had? It was a lot cooler looking than the new one. I've got a copy, in case you lost it:
