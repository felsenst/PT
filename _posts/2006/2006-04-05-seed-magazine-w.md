Details can be found [here.](http://seedmagazine.com/writingcontest/)  I thought this may be of interest to some folks here, as the essay topic is on that we've discussed here previously:

> Amidst emerging competitive threats from abroad (China and India in particular) and heated debates over intelligent design, stem cells and climate change: What is the future of science in America? What should the US do to preserve and build upon its role as a leader in scientific innovation?

Top prize is $1000 and publication in Seed magazine.  Entry deadline is June 30, 2006.
