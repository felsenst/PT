<img src="http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/sse2006/images/stonybrooklogo.gif" alt="" style="float:left;" />The schedule for the special symposium on "[Intelligent Design on Trial: Lessons from the Kitzmiller v. Dover creationism case](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/sse2006/symposia.html)," on Monday, June 26, 2006 at the [Society for the Study of Evolution meeting](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/sse2006/) at SUNY-Stony Brook has been **updated** (see below).

**Further update:** Rob Pennock informs me that the symposium _will be videotaped_, with the intention of putting it on the internet after the meeting.

In other news, although some [helpful](/archives/2006/06/sse-2006-meetin.html#comment-104150) [suggestions](/archives/2006/06/sse-2006-meetin.html#comment-104296) have been made, I am still [seeking housing](/archives/2006/06/sse-2006-meetin.html#comment-104273) for June 24-27, since I was invited only after dorm housing had closed.  Like I said, I'll pay my share and bring a sleeping pad or something.  Surely there is a penniless grad student out there somewhere.  Email me: matzkeATncseweb.org. (**Update:** found housing and received several kind offers.  Thanks very much.)

Also, I just noticed that in just one day PT became the [top google hit](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=SSE+2006&amp;btnG=Google+Search) for "SSE 2006", while the [actual meeting website](http://www.sunysb.edu/sse2006) is ranked #6.
