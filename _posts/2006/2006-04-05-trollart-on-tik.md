People have been talking about the discovery of [two more new gaps](/archives/2006/04/tiktaalik-makes.html) in the fossil record of the fish-tetrapod transition, which occurred when [scientists found](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/full/440747a.html) a predicted intermediate fossil, which they named _Tiktaalik_.
