The latest on the Hovind trial: [Workers testify in 'Dr. Dino' trial](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061019/NEWS01/610190338/1006).  That should be "'Dr.' Dino", of course.

Apparently he has sued the IRS at least 3 times.  Not exactly the best way to get them on your good side...
