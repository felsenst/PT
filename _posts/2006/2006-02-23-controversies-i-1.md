['Jurassic beaver' unearthed in China](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11522136/):  Fossil overturns ideas about mammals' lowly status in dinosaur era

> For years, the mammals living in the era of dinosaurs have been thought of as tiny shrewlike creatures scurrying through the underbrush. Now the discovery of a furry aquatic creature with seallike teeth and a flat tail like a beaver has demolished that image.
