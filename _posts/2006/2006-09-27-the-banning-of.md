Monday, [I posted an entry here](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2006/09/help_help_im_being_repressed.php) that discussed, in part,  [a Discovery Institute blog article](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/banned_book_of_the_year_of_pan.html) claiming that the Dover ruling qualifies the [cdesign proponentsists](/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html) textbook Of Pandas and People as a "banned book." As I explained at the time, the claim is complete and total nonsense, so I suppose I really should have guessed that the anti-evolution movement would get behind it in a hell of a hurry. 

That appears to be just what's happening. The latest twists involve [the Uncommon Descent blog](http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1652) and [the Wikipedia entry for banned books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banned_books).
