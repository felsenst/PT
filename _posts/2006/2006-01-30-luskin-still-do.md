[I wrote up a critique ](http://aetiology.blogspot.com/2005/10/intelligently-designed-avian-flu.html) of an article DI mouthpiece Casey Luskin [wrote regarding avian influenza](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/10/avian_flu_an_example_of_evolution.htm) back in October.   I don't know whether Luskin ever read my post; at the time, trackbacks to the DI site weren't working.  But I'd guess I'm not the only one who pointed out the abundant mistakes in his article, which advanced the thesis that avian influenza wasn't a good example of evolution.  He has since written a response to critics [here](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=658) (warning: .pdf file), correcting one of his errors in the original article (and making a confusing mess out of things).  

Luskin's original thesis was that H5N1 wasn't a good example of evolution because, he claimed, it was simply a reassortant virus:  an avian-human hybrid.  Therefore, the "evolution" was not any "new information," but simply a move of information that already existed.  Only, of course, the H5N1 strain circulating \*isn't\* a reassortant virus:  it's a pure avian virus.  You might think that this tidbit of information would shoot down Luskin's whole thesis, but no, he struggles on.
