It looks like tomorrow's South Park is going to include a challenge on the teaching of evolution.

> Cartman's plan to propel himself into the future goes horribly wrong in an all-new "South Park" premiering Wednesday, November 1 at 10:00 p.m. on Comedy Central. South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution being taught to the 4th graders. The most vocal protests are from Ms. Garrison who has to teach it. Eric Cartman can't be bothered with what's going on in class. He's busy manipulating his own personal time-line to align with the precise release date of the newest, hottest game.

I hope [Colorado Citizens for Science](http://www.coloradocfs.org/) and [Colorado Evolution Response Team](http://www.evolutionarygenomics.com/CERT/CERT.html) are ready to defend science eduction for the students of South Park, Colorado.
