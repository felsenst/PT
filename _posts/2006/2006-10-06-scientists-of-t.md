Chris Mooney's article in the November issue of _Seed_ is [up on the _Seed_ website](http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/10/science_2006.php). It is about the new group [Scientists and Engineers for America](http://www.sefora.org) ([SEforA](http://www.sefora.org)) which made a [splash in the _New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/us/politics/28science.html) last week.

> For too long scientists have approached politics with one hand tied behind their backs. This November, Chris Mooney says, that's going to change.

He also has a blog post up, "[Scientists of the World, Unite!](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/09/scientists_of_america_unite.php)"
