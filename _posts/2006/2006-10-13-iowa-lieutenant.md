[Vander Plaats supports teaching intelligent design](http://www.midiowanews.com/site/tab1.cfm?newsid=17317373&amp;BRD=2700&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=554432&amp;rfi=6)

>   "If we are going to teach evolution, there is another viewpoint and one that holds pretty good too (evolution) in regards to creation," Vander Plaats said. "I think that is something that I would want to visit further along with Jim Nussle in regards to 'Where are you at on that?' But my viewpoint is I would like to give both of these (time in the classroom)."

For those of you unfamiliar wth Iowa politics, [Jim Nussle](http://www.jimnussle.com/nussle/) is the Republican candidate for governor, opposed by Democrat [Chet Culver.](http://www.chetculver.com/)  Bob Vander Plaats, as noted, is Nussle's running mate.
