<p>A while back Mark Perakh wrote <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Sewell.cfm">this essay</a> dissecting the attempt by mathematician Granville Sewell to revive the thermodynamics argument against evolution.</p>

<p>Actually, Sewell's argument was so bad that I felt there was even more to say beyond Mark's fine analysis.  The fruits of my labors are <a href="http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/thermodynamics.html">now available</a> at CSICOP's <a href="http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/">Creation and ID Watch</a> website.</p>
