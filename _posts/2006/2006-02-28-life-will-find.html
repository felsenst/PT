<p class="lead">Creationists sometimes try to argue that what we consider straightforward, well-demonstrated cytological and genetic events don't and can't occur: that you <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/a_straightforward_example_of_creationist_error/">can't get chromosome rearrangements</a>, or that variations in chromosome number and organization are obstacles to evolution, making <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/pufferfish_and_ancestral_genomes/">discussions of synteny</a>, or the rearrangement of chromosomal material in evolution, an impossibility. These are absurd conclusions, of course&mdash;we see evidence of chromosomal variation in people all the time.</p>

<p>For example, A friend sent along (yes, Virginia, there is a secret network of evilutionists busily sharing information with one another) a remarkable case study of a radical chromosome arrangement in a mother and daughter. When you see how these chromosomes are scrambled, you'll wonder how they ever managed to sort themselves out meiotically to produce viable offspring&hellip;but life will find a way.</p>
