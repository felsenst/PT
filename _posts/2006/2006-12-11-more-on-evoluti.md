My [recent post on evolution and political conservatism](/archives/2006/11/the-politically-14.html) started an interesting conversation over the relationship between science, conservatism, and libertarianism, between myself and Larry Arnhart. [Here](http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-fusionism.html) is Arnhart's first post, [my reply](http://positiveliberty.com/2006/12/arnhart-responds-to-my-review.html), his [surreply,](http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2006/12/another-response-to-sandefur.html) and [my most recent comment.](http://positiveliberty.com/2006/12/arnhart-responds.html)
