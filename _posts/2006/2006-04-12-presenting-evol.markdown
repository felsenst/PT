With the recent <a href=/archives/2006/04/tiktaalik-makes.html>discovery of <i>Tiktaalik</i></a>, and the paper in <i>Science</i> showing that yet another complex biological system <a href=http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/04/evolution_of_ic_1.html>has now yielded</a> to an evolutionary explanation, evoution has been in the news quite a bit lately.  That inevitably leads to thoughts about how best to present evolution to the public.  I offer some thoughts on that subject in two entries over at EvolutionBlog:  <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/presenting-evolution_10.html>Part One here</a> and <a href=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/presenting-evolution-part-two.html>Part Two here</a>.  Part One discusses Bill Nye's appearance on the MSNBC show <i>Countdown</i>, and some of the press releases related to the <i>Science</i> paper.  Part two discusses <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/11/science/sciencespecial2/11prof.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>this article</a>, from today's <i>New York Times</i>, about the recent film <i>Flock of Dodos</i>.  Enjoy!
