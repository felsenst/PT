A few people commenting on <a href="/archives/2006/01/happy-birthday-3.html">my post about Jacob Bronowski</a> asked if <em>The Ascent of Man </em>was available on DVD. A friend has emailed to let me know that it is available not only on European-DVD format, but also <a href="http://www.documentary-video.com/displayitem.cfm?vid=860">on a format readable by U.S. DVD players.</a>
