<p class="lead">A reader wrote to Francis Collins about the use of his name to promote <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/et_tu_francis_collins.php">D. James Kennedy's upcoming ahistorical anti-evolution program</a>, and Collins wrote right back. He's doing exactly the right thing.</p>

<p>(Oops, no &mdash; Collins doesn't want to be quoted on this, so I've removed the email. He's unambiguous in stating that he was interviewed about his book, and that was then inserted into the video without his knowledge.)</p>

<p>Good for him, and that'll teach me: just when you think there are no further depths to which a creationist will sink, there they go, plumbing ever deeper. Kennedy and his crew are apparently putting together the video equivalent of a quote mine.</p>

<p>I apologize to Dr Collins for assuming he was a party to this creationist video, and I hope he sues those frauds.</p>
