So, you may or may not be aware of the latest "challenge" to evolutionary theory--DI Fellow Jonathan Wells' new book, ["The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design."](/archives/2006/08/the-politically-0.html)  Following in the footsteps of Tom Bethell's "Politically Incorrect Guide to Science" (whose terrible chapter on AIDS I reviewed [here](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/02/post_3.php)), the book is just all shades of terrible.  (As has been pointed out by many others who've read books in the "Politically Incorrect" series, they should just drop the pretense of "Politically"--simply "Incorrect" sums them up much better).  I'll have a more comprehensive review of one of Wells' chapters (discussing, essentially, how evolution plays no role in medicine, antibiotic resistance, etc.) next week some time, and you'll be seeing others pop up as well (see [this post](/archives/2006/08/the-politically.html) for the collected links), but for today I want to focus on a small part of the final chapter (titled "Scientific Revolution".  Yeah, go ahead and snicker).  

You probably remember Forest Mims III.  He was the other party in the ["Eric Pianka advocates genocide"](/archives/2006/04/forrest-mims-cr.html) saga.  (See also [here](/archives/2006/04/mims-dishing-it.html) and [here](/archives/2006/04/forrest-mimss-t.html) to remind yourself of the absurdity of the whole situation).  Mims is a [creationist](http://www.skepticfiles.org/evo2/mims.htm) and another [Discovery Institute Fellow](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;isFellow=true&amp;id=35), and an amateur scientist.  According to Wells, he's made a bizarre claim:  that the fact that influenza viruses haven't evolved resistance to UV light is evidence for design.  I thought that [Casey Luskin's piece on intelligent design and flu](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2005/10/intelligently_designed_avian_f.php) was as bad as it gets, but I think this is a toss-up; you just can't make this stuff up.
