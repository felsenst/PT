This week's _Science_ contains the statement that [Medicine needs evolution:](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/311/5764/1071)

> The citation of "Evolution in Action" as Science's 2005 breakthrough of the year confirms that evolution is the vibrant foundation for all biology. Its contributions to understanding infectious disease and genetics are widely recognized, but its full potential for use in medicine has yet to be realized. Some insights have immediate clinical applications, but most are fundamental, as is the case in other basic sciences. Simply put, training in evolutionary thinking can help both biomedical researchers and clinicians ask useful questions that they might not otherwise pose.

The statement was written in part by Randolph Neese, an author of the book [Why we get sick:  the new science of Darwinian medicine.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679746749/sr=8-1/qid=1140801504/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0116602-6282363?%5Fencoding=UTF8)  I've written before about [working on getting doctors involved in the fight to teach good science](http://aetiology.blogspot.com/2005/12/ama-op-ed-loopy-times-and-what-medical.html) and voice support for evolution, since medicine is a major place where the rubber hits the road as far as usefulness of the discoveries and theory of evolutionary biology.  The authors also make some suggestions for reforming medical and pre-medical curriculum.
