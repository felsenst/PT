One of the most fascinating aspects of the last couple weeks since the Dover ruling came down is surveying just how low some of the IDers are willing to go to attack Judge Jones. It's all the more interesting because when he was assigned the case they were quite happy about the selection. After all, they had gotten a conservative judge, appointed by President Bush and with close ties to Tom Ridge and Rick Santorum. How could they have asked for anything more? Alas, once he ruled against them they turned on him like a pack of rabid dogs, engaging in one ad hominem after another. But the worst I've seen has to be [this piece](http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/phyllisschlafly/2006/01/02/180785.html) by Phyllis Schlaffly, which DI boss John West is [endorsing](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/schlafly_criticizes_judge_jone.html). Her column is chock full of ignorance and flat out lies. 

To see the full fisking of Schlaffly's column, go to [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2006/01/fisking_phyllis_schlaffly.php). Comments may be left there.
