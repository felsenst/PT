<p class="lead">The mighty Kent Hovind <a title="Kent Hovind - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind#Dinosaur_Adventure_Land">has struck out</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>On June 5th 2006, Hovind pled nolo contendere as
charged to three counts: constructing a building
without a permit, refusing to sign a citation and
violating the county building code. Hovind was ordered
to pay $225.00 per count. The plea brings to an end a
5-year battle over a $50.00 building permit. Hovind
estimates he spent $40,000 in legal expenses on this
case. Meanwhile, the property taxes for Dinosaur
Adventure Land are in arrears in an amount of
$10,338.36 ($4,955.23 for 2005 and 5,383.13 for 2003
and 2004).</p>

<p>In both criminal and civil trials in the United
States, a plea of "nolo contendere" means that the
defendant neither admits nor disputes the charge or no
contest. It literally means "I do not wish to
contend." Spiro Agnew famously approximated it as "I
didn't do it, but I'll never do it again." This plea
is only recognised in the U.S. No formal plea is
required in civil matters where paper pleadings are
used.</p></blockquote>
