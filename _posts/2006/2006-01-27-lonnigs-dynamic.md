In the comments section of my most recent post on the Discovery Institute's publication track record, Spike made [the following suggestion](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/how_can_you_tel.html#comment-75940):

I started out intending to examine the entire paper, but it's taken me a while to thoroughly respond to (or dismember, if you prefer) just one of the claims. I do have other things to do, so I'm going to restrict my response to addressing his claims about the lack of differences seen between organisms. This doesn't mean I agree with the rest of the paper - it just means that I only have so much time available for this right now.
