I asked awhile back for [some of your thoughts on improving science education](/archives/2005/12/how-would-you-s.html), particularly in the U.S.  In yesterday's NY Times, there was a story about [discussing one measure that might help in this area:](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/education/22grants.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=81cd1a4fda833059&amp;hp&amp;ex=1137992400&amp;partner=homepage)


> The measure, backed by the Bush administration and expected to pass the House when it returns next month, would provide $750 to $1,300 grants to low-income college freshmen and sophomores who have completed "a rigorous secondary school program of study" and larger amounts to juniors and seniors majoring in math, science and other critical fields.

Sounds good initially.  The problem:

>  It leaves it to the secretary of education to define rigorous, giving her a new foothold in matters of high school curriculums.

  The rest of the article grapples with those issues, so I'll leave that to you to read (registration may be required).  

After examining the pros and cons, what do you think of the idea?  \*Should\* the national government set some standards for a "rigorous program of study" for the kids to meet to receive these grants?  Is there a better way to dole them out?  Should they be offered at all?  I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.
