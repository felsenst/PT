Over at [Darwin Central](http://www.darwincentral.org), some impressively-obsessed blogger has [attempted to rate 50 creationist websites](http://www.darwincentral.org/blog/2006/06/02/pied-pipers-at-the-gates-of-dawn/) on their propensity to use commonly-mined quotes.  Methods: (1) start with the quotes in the [Talkorigins.org Quote-Mine Project](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html); (2) search for those quotes on the creationist websites; (3) somehow put it all in a relational database; (4) tabulate.

The winner, with 75 of the 158 quotes listed at Talkorigins, was [Anointed-one.net/](http://www.anointed-one.net/).  It is followed by a couple of sites that are primarily creationist quote-mine collections (studying the evolution of such collections would be an interesting project).  [Answers in Genesis](http://www.answersingenesis.org/) (#9), the [ICR website](http://www.icr.org/) (#8), and [Harun Yahya](http://www.harunyahya.com/) (#5)  make the top ten list, but the famous Velikovskian [Ted](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/teds-world.html) [Holden](http://www.ediacara.org/ted.html), aka [The Inimitable One](http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/jargon/jargonfile_i.html), beats them all with his website [bearfabrique.org](http://www.bearfabrique.org/) (#4).  The [Discovery Institute](http://www.discovery.org/) comes out at a disappointing #30, but there is a lot of competition out there, and they spend a lot of their time trying to dumb down the education of U.S. children.

All in all, this is a rather impressive effort, and another example of the kind of "creoinformatics" that the web and modern technology makes possible.
