Get your [Charles Darwin Bobblehead](http://www.science.siu.edu/zoology/darwin/#bobblehead) now!  (In support of [SIU's Darwin Day 2007](http://www.science.siu.edu/zoology/darwin/).)

(_Note: In the previous version of this post the Darwin Bobbleheads were about three feet tall _as displayed on the monitor_ and so didn't even fit on the screen.  The poster responsible has been sacked._)
