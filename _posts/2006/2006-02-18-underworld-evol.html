<p class="lead">I saw the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401855/"><i>Underworld: Evolution</i></a> last night. Stop looking at me like that&mdash;it was <i>research</i>. It has the word "evolution" in the title, doesn't it? Besides, I have this idea to improve the promotion of science by having all of our spokespeople be dangerously nubile armed women with good cheekbones, full lips, and very sharp teeth. I figure the two things we've been lacking in our presentations to the public are lust and fear, and if we can just bring those into play, we'll have an unbeatable combination.</p>

<p>As I learned at this movie, too, if you've got gorgeous women and slimy, ravening beasts confronting each other with big guns, nothing in the story has to make any sense at all. There was no plot: instead, there are a series of set-pieces strung together in which Our Heroine is placed in someplace dark, wet, and seedy with a supply of weapons and hapless allies/fang fodder to confront a suitably snouty or batty SFX playtoy. They aren't even consistent in how these conflicts are resolved. Big bad immortal vampires get shot multiple times at point blank range with a shotgun, and shake it off with a snarl; but when Sir Derek Jacobi, following in the fine British tradition of slumming in some well-paying American trash, finds the movie so embarrassingly bad that he has to get out, the movie makers decide that the way to have his immortal character die is to poke him with something pointy, followed by a languorous death scene in which Jacobi <i>completely turns off his ability to act</i>. It was impressively flat, a cinematic vampire death scene that ranks right up there with Pee Wee Herman's in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103893/"><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a>, yet utterly different.</p>

<p>Somehow this murky, muddled mess of a movie got made, and got people (like, say, me!) to attend. There's a lesson here.</p>

<p>I'm going to have to get a skin-tight vinyl body suit for my next presentation.</p>

<p>I'll let you guess whether I'm trying to inspire lust or fear.</p>
