> One historical event that has been the subject of much speculation over the decades has been the [Plague of Athens,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Thuc.+2.47-55.html) a mysterious outbreak that is thought to have changed the direction of the Peloponnesian War, and for which the cause still remains uncertain.  
> 
> This plague has been attributed to [bubonic plague](http://www.macalester.edu/%7Ecuffel/molecularplague.htm), toxic shock syndrome and/or necrotizing fasciitis due to _Streptococcus pyogenes_ or _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Salmonella_, yellow fever, malaria, Ebola, influenza, and smallpox, to name just a few.  [Typhus](http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/athens.html) seems to fit the description best, but it's likely that a cause will never be known with certainty.

Little did I know when I posted that on my old blog (just last month!)  that [a study had already been accepted to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases](http://www.elsevier-international.com/journals/suppfile/flat/ijid_athens.pdf) suggesting that it's not typhus (caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_), but typhoid fever (_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi) that appears to be the cause of the plague.
