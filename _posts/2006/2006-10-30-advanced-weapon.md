In what looks like "News of the Weird", we have a [report from Monroe County, Michigan](http://www.monroenews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061026/NEWS01/110260028/-1/NEWS) of an antievolution activist taking up arms against the system. What sort of "intelligent design" weapons technology might the modern antievolutionist use? According to the report, Mark A. Wood entered the school offices of Monroe Middle School asking if people thought he looked like an ape while holding onto... a brick.

> A man waving a brick barged into Monroe Middle School and ranted about the teachings of evolution before being arrested by police Tuesday morning.

> "The best part is, no students were in danger," Mr. McLeod said. "Fortunately for us, he came right into the office. It's pretty obvious he was kind of disturbed."
