<p class="lead">The <a href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/10/13/tangled-bank-number-64/">latest Tangled Bank</a> is online (a little bit late) at <a href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/">Neurophilosophy</a>. My notice is a little bit late, too, but in one of those odd coincidences, it's because I'm in London&hellip;as is this week's host, and I met him at the natural history museum yesterday.</p>

<p>Better late than never, and just in case you haven't read it already, head on over.</p>
