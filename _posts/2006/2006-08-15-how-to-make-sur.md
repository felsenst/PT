Lawrence Krauss tells us in an article in today's [_New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/science/sciencespecial2/15essa.html).  Step one:  Have people who think that the Earth is only 6500 years old running your school board:  

> The chairman of the school board, Dr. Steve Abrams, a veterinarian, is not merely a strict creationist. He has openly stated that he believes that God created the universe 6,500 years ago, although he was quoted in The New York Times this month as saying that his personal faith "doesn't have anything to do with science."
> 
> "I can separate them," he continued, adding, "My personal views of Scripture have no room in the science classroom."
> 
> A key concern should not be whether Dr. Abrams's religious views have a place in the classroom, but rather how someone whose religious views require a denial of essentially all modern scientific knowledge can be chairman of a state school board.

   

As they say, read the [whole thing](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/science/sciencespecial2/15essa.html).
