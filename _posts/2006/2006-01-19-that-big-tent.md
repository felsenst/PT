Buridan of [Buridan's ass](http://www.buridansass.com) has some discussion about [Vedic creation in America](http://www.buridansass.com/archives/2006/01/vedic_creationism_in_america.html) ([Short EvoWiki blurb on vedic creationism](http://www.evowiki.org/index.php/Vedic_creationism)), linking an article that claims

> Prominent I.D. theorists (Philip Johnson, Michael Behe) and some Catholic creationists have endorsed Vedic creationism.
