The early word is that PT contributor Reed Cartwright ([real webpage](http://www2.genetics.uga.edu/gradwebsite/studprofiles/Cartwright.html)) ([alter ego](http://www.dererumnatura.us/)) has, despite being a PT poster, helping to construct the PT blog, and spending his time annoying creationists, [managed to PASS](http://www.dererumnatura.us/archives/2006/06/two_good_things.html) his dissertation defense.  Watch out world, here comes Dr. Cartwright.
