...Tricks like [a dog cancer cell](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/08/09/an_old_dog_lives_on_inside_new.php) becoming an independent pathogen and spreading through the dog population.  Drop everything and go read [Carl Zimmer's post about the recent discovery of a dog cancer cell lineage that has left behind its multicellular ancestry](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/08/09/an_old_dog_lives_on_inside_new.php).  Rather like [HeLa cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa), except in the wild without human help.  If I thought that "phylum" and "phylum-level bodyplan" were inviolable, unchanging character complexes ([which I don'](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000969.html)t), this example of a super-phyletic macroevolutionary change, on microevolutionary timescales, would rock my world.
