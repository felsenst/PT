This week's _Nature_ [reports](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7113/full/443746a.html) on the expansion of John van Wyhe's [massive online archive](http://darwin-online.org.uk/) of Darwin writings, hosted by the University of Cambridge.  I believe it now includes all of Darwin's books and articles (yes, Virginia, Darwin [wrote journal articles](http://darwin-online.org.uk/contents.html#periodicals)), except maybe the second edition of [_Insectivorous Plants_](http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_InsectivorousPlants.html).  The [first edition](http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_InsectivorousPlants.html) was published in 1875, but was revised in 1888 by Francis Darwin.  So maybe that is a grey area, but I can still whine about it.
