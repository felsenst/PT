Lou Dobbs will be "discussing" ID at 6:00 pm (Eastern Time) tonight.  Rob Hovis, a strong defender of honest science education on the Ohio State Board of Education, will be on the show along with another OBOE Board member -- possibly ID creationist Deborah Owens Fink, who introduced a "two model" (ID and Evo) motion to the Board in 2000.  Anyone remember Debbie denying that they want ID taught in Ohio publics schools?  Yeah, sure.
