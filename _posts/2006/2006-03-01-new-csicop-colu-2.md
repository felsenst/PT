**Update** (March 2, 2006):  I owe an apology to readers of this entry for an error I made in its initial version.  I originally presented two quotes, one of which I attributed to Henry Morris, the other to William Dembski.  In reality both quotes were due to Morris.  The point I was making was that both ID and scientific creationism assert that the question of the age of the Earth is independent of the scientific question of whether evolution is an adequate explanation for life's complexity.  But in writing this entry I carelssly misread what I had originally written in my essay.  I am sorry for the error. 

My [new column](http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/differences.html) for CSICOP'S [Creation Watch](http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/) web site is now available.  This time we take a closer look at the question of whether there is any important difference between ID and scientific creationism.  Turns out there's even less of a difference than you think!
