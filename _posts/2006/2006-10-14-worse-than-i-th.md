As one [commenter at Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/10/iowa_lieutenant_governor_candi.php#comment-239875) pointed out, support for Intelligent design/creationism is included in the [Republican Party of Iowa State Platform](http://www.iowagop.org/About/Default.aspx?SectionId=239):

> 3.4 We support the teaching of alternative theories on the origins of life including Darwinian Evolution, Creation Science or Intelligent Design, and that each should be given equal weight in presentation.

What I don't know is if this is typical of other Republican platforms in other states, or how frequently each candidate uses these points in their own campaign.  I've still not heard back either from Nussle or Culver regarding Intelligent Design, either...
