As many of the [Sciencebloggers](http://scienceblogs.com) have already mentioned, Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute is up to his usual stupidity. In this particular instance, [he's attempting, in a typically inept fashion, to fisk Carl Zimmer's](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/11/13/getting_the_mooney_treatment.php) [recent article in National Geographic](http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0611/feature4/). So far, I haven't chimed in, mostly because everyone else has done such a good job that there wasn't much to add. 

Today, though, [Karmen pointed out a passage](http://scienceblogs.com/chaoticutopia/2006/11/puzzling_at_a_simpleminded_cre.php) that I'd somehow missed the first time I read Luskin's piece. In [the first part](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/11/evolution_nat_geo_1.html) of his "rebuttal," Luskin wrote:


> The article called evolution a "simple" process. In our experience, does a "simple" process generate the type of vast complexity found throughout biology?


[Karmen](http://scienceblogs.com/chaoticutopia/2006/11/puzzling_at_a_simpleminded_cre.php) and [PZ](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/11/i_should_have_kept_reading.php) have both already pointed out the silliness of claiming that simple processes can't lead to complex results. I'm going to talk about something different, but every bit as silly: the idea that evolution is a _simple_ process.
