She was only 176.  Some IDists are so desperate for good news -- and evidently so superstitious -- they are hopefully interpreting Harriet's passing as an omen (see "[A presage of another death?](http://designparadigm.blogsome.com/2006/06/24/a-presage-of-another-death/)").  Others might note that the fact that Darwin's pet tortoise was an international celebrity, whose death was widely mourned, is not exactly encouraging news for the evolution-deniers out there.

A not quite totally inappropriate poem from Mike Myer's 1993 movie _So I Married an Axe Murderer_:

> _Harriet.
> Sweet Harriet.
> Hard-hearted harbinger of haggus. 
> 
> Beautiful, bemused, belicose butcher.
> 
> So knowing, so trusting, so lov-ed.
> 
> He wants you back he screams into the night air, 
> like a fireman going to a window that has no fire, 
> 'cept the passion of his heart.
> 
> I am lonely, 
> It's really hard. 
> 
> This poem sucks._
