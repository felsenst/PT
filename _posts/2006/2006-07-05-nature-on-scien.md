[Nature](http://www.nature.com/), one of the top journals for scientific research, published [an article today about the most popular science blogs](http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/full/442009a.html).  The Panda's Thumb came out number two, and Jack Krebs was quoted about our success:

> Being a group blog is key, says contributor Jack Krebs, president of Kansas Citizens for Science. "We have some of the most well-informed observers and critics of the 'intelligent design' and creationist movements." The nature of the topic helps too, he adds. "There is an interest, a hunger even, for thoughtful analysis of the issues related to evolution and creationism."

In addition, PT contributor, PZ Myers, found his personal blog, [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/) as the most popular science blog.

Over all, six of [the top fifty science blogs](http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/50_science_blogs.html) were personal blogs of PT contributors.
