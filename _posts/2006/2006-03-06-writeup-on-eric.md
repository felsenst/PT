A nice long writeup on Eric Rothschild, one of the lead attorneys for the Plaintiffs in the _Kitzmiller_ case, has just come out in the [_Pennsylvania Gazette_](http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/index.html), the UPenn alumni magazine.  The cover article is entitled "[Intelligent Demise](http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0306/feature1.html)" and focuses on Rothschild's dissection of ID arguments during the trial.  Rothschild seems to come off slightly better than fellow UPenn alum Michael Behe... 

[A second article](http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0306/feature2.html) examines the role a UPenn commission played in debunking spiritualism in the 19th century.
