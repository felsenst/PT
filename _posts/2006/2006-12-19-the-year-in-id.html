<p>What a year it has been for the Discovery Institute and the Intelligent Design movement! <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/12/the_year_in_id.php">Over at Stranger Fruit</a>, I detail the advances that ID has made in the short time since Judge Jones delivered his ruling in <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover</em>.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> John West has offered <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/12/the_year_in_id_di_version.php">his version</a> of the year for ID. Compare and contrast at your leisure</p>
