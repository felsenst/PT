<p>Readers of this blog are doubtless familiar with the Discovery Institute's <a href="http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/">anemic list</a> of scientists who &ldquo;dissent from Darwinism.&rdquo;  The list is sadly short on biologists, forcing the DI to accept anyone with a PhD in any branch of science as a possible signatory.</p>

<p>Casey Luskin attempts to defend this practice by <a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/07/mathematicians_and_evolution.html">explaining why</a> mathematicians are supremely well-placed to offer authoritative pronouncements on the merits of evolutionary theory.</p>

<p>Over at EvolutionBlog, I have replied to his desperate sputterings.  In <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2006/07/are_mathematicians_qualified_t.php#more">Part One</a> I discuss the question of whether mathematicians, or non-biologists generally, have any authority to be discussing evolutionary theory.  In <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2006/07/are_mathematicians_qualified_t_1.php">Part Two</a> I consider Luskin's thoughts on the matter.  Comments can be left there.  Enjoy!</p>
