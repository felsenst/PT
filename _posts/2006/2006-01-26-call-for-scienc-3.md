<p>This coming week will be a great one for science carnivals. First up is the [Circus of the Spineless](http://invertebrates.blogspot.com/) which will appear on [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/) on Sunday&mdash;if you've written anything about invertebrates in the past month, send the link to pzmyers@pharyngula.org by Saturday evening.</p>

<p>The second big event is the next edition of the [Tangled Bank](http://tangledbank.net/), scheduled for Wednesday, 1 February, at [Adventures in Ethics and Science](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/01/coming_soon_a_new_edition_of_t.php). Send links to _any_ science writing to dr.freeride@gmail.com, pzmyers@pharyngula.org, or host@tangledbank.net by next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hey&hellip;and if you written something about the science of invertebrates, send the link to both!</p>

*********

<p>One last thing&hellip;the schedule of future Tangled Bank hosts has been updated with an influx of new volunteers. We've got stuff lined up through July; check the list below if you volunteered to see when your turn is coming up. And if you aren't there and you want to be, send a note to pzmyers@pharyngula.org and I'll add you to the list.</p>
