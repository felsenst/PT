_**Ed Note**: This update comes from a member of [Alabama Citizens for Science](http://www.alscience.org/).  It concerns [SB45/HB106, the "Academic Freedom Act"](http://www.legislature.state.al.us/SearchableInstruments/2006RS/Bills/SB45.htm), which intends to give any teacher at any level the "freedom" to corrupt science education for any reason.  The 2006 version drops the obvious anti-evolution language of its failed predecessors._

This is an update on SB45, the "Academic Freedom Act" currently  wending its way through the Alabama Senate.

Last week's "Public Hearing" was truncated because of lack of time  and supposed to be finished today (Wednesday March 8) at 8:30 AM.

I went to the Senate Education Committee meeting this morning. They  had 7 bills on the agenda, including two which had public hearings,  but they only had the room reserved for 30 minutes and they started  10 minutes late. Half of the Senators on the committee weren't even  there for the first 15 minutes, so they missed what little there was  of the "public hearing", in which only one supporter and one opponent  of SB45 were allowed to speak (we had at least 5 speakers there, and  the creationists had at least 2).

The one supporter was a man who appeared to be in his late 70's or  older, who they identified as Dr Frady. If anyone knows who this  might have been, please let me know. His primary point was that Alabama  needed more diversity of viewpoints in schools. It was pretty much  standard creationist boilerplate.

The one opponent was John Draper, president of the professional  association of Alabama public school principals and superintendents  (http://www.clasleaders.com/). His primary objection was that SB45 would  allow teachers to bring ideas such as racism, abortion and Atheism  into the classroom. This resonated well with the Senators.

Several Senators on the committee had problems with various  particulars in the bill, and tried to amend it and/or change it.  Chief among these was Bradley Byrne, Republican from Mobile, who was  not supportive of evolution when he was on the State Board of  Education in 2001 but actually had some pretty constructive ideas  this time. The changes were so extensive that the chair (Senator  Vivian Figures) would not let the committee vote on any version of  SB45, and requested that it be revised and presented again at a later  meeting (next week?) of the Senate Education Committee.

The meeting then adjourned because another committee had reserved the  room for 9:00.

I think it is pretty clear that SB45 will not pass in its current  form. There are several ways that they can change it to improve its  chances. The most likely, I think, is that they will exempt  kindergarten thru 12th grade (K-12) and make it apply only to public  colleges, universities, and graduate schools. This alternative got  the votes of all 6 Democrats on the House Education Committee (the  House Republicans , and have some attractiveness to both Democrats  and Republicans in the Senate Education Committee today. Since the  main opposition has come from professional associations of K-12  educators, this alternative will keep them from opposing SB45 because  it will not effect them.

I have not heard from any Alabama public universities how they will  stand on SB45 with this change. I doubt that they will like it, but I  have not seen them working against SB45 or HB106 (the House version),  and every "Academic Freedom Act" since they first surfaced in 2004  would have effected them if passed.

It is clear that all of our efforts are paying off. Certainly getting  K-12 out of this horrendous bill protects our most vulnerable students.
