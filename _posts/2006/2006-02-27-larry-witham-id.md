I am currently re-reading Larry Witham's 2003 overview of the intelligent design movement, _By Design:   Science and the Search for God_.   Those who follow the ID movement closely know Witham as a former religion reporter for the Moonie-controlled Washington _Times_, and as the author of several uncritical articles about ID.    Another tip-off that the content would be slanted was that this volume was donated to my university by the Trinity Evangelical Missionary Church, a local group that has donated a significant fraction of the antievolutionary content of our library.  So it did not come as a surprise to me in my first reading that _By Design_ was slanted.  What _did_ come as a surprise was the level of bias and misrepresentation, even to the point of blatant self-contradiction.  I've finally gotten around to listing some of them.
