Remember last month when Nature published that [crank creationist letter](/archives/2006/11/nature-publishe.html) from Polish politician and scientist Maciej Giertych?  Well this week Nature has published responses to that letter.  PZ has posted the list on his blog: '[Pigpile on Maciej Giertych!](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/pigpile_on_maciej_giertych.php)'.

Go check them out and come back here and tell me which one is the best.
