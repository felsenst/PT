Wondering what ever happened to all that ID inspired scientific progress that was supposedly just around the corner?  Here's Bruce Chapman [explaining why](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/10/the_state_of_scientific_resear.html#more) it hasn't materialized:

> Friends of ID know the cases of a number of ID-friendly scientists who have lost their lab privileges or otherwise been discriminated against at universities here and in the UK. We are not trumpeting very many cases because the situations of several such scientists remain difficult. It is an appalling commentary on the state of academic freedom that ID-friendly scientists should have to work in an atmosphere of fear, but it's true. We just want friends of ID who wonder why we don't publicize work in progress more than we do to take a moment and reflect about that!
> 
> As for foes and critics who pester us for information about research now underway and who insinuate that, unless we oblige them, we must accept their opinion that such research is not happening, we owe them nothing. Since when does a scientist have to &ldquo;report&rdquo; on his work to the public before he is ready? The opposite is almost always the case.

There's lot's of ID research, but a conspiracy of censorship prevents us from telling you about it.  Lot's of people are being oppressed by Darwinists, but we can't tell you who they are.

RIght.  And people who deny the existence of robots are themselves robots.
