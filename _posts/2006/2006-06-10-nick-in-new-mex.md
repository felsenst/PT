We in **[New](http://www.cesame-nm.org/)   [Mexico](http://www.nmsr.org/index.htm)** are honored to have PT's own Nick Matzke as our guest this weekend.

Nick was in-studio on the NMSR Science Watch radio show today, and gave a gripping rundown of the Dover ID Trial from the inside...

_KABQ 1350 AM Board Op Lindsey sets levels for Nick on the Science Watch radio show (Sat 10th)_

AND, Nick is giving a **FREE SPEECH** tomorrow (Sunday, June 11th) at UNM's Anthropology lecture hall.

**[COME ON BY!](http://www.nmsr.org/meetings.htm)**

It's sponsored by [**CESE**](http://www.cesame-nm.org/).

Nick is not the first guest from PT to appear on NMSR's Science Watch, not counting regular co-host Dave Thomas.

No sir - Nick's been preceded by none other than [Professor Steve Steve himself](/archives/2005/09/steve-steve-arr.html)!
