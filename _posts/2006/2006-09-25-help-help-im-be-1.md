Two recent posts over at the Discovery Institute's Media Complaints Division blog have me ready to break out the world's smallest violin. Their new (well, newish, anyway - it's popped up from time to time before) argument is that they are being discriminated against. [In the first](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/censorship_rears_its_ugly_head.html) of the two articles, Rob Crowther argues that "Darwinists" are trying to "censor" academic freedom in Michigan. [In the second](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/banned_book_of_the_year_of_pan.html), John West starts by suggesting that "Of Pandas and People" should be the "Banned Book of the Year," and concludes with the outrageous and insulting claim that the "ultimate goal here is to ban ideas." 

The two posts, unsurprisingly enough, are jam packed with statements that are in gross conflict with reality. I'm not going to go into those here, although there are one or two I'm considering taking a swing at later. Instead, I'm going to focus on their root claim that objecting to what they want to do in the classroom constitutes some sort of "censorship."
