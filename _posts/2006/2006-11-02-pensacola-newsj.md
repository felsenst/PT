[This just in](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061102/NEWS01/611020330/1006) from the _Pensacola News-Journal_:

> **['Dr. Dino,' wife guilty](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061102/NEWS01/611020330/1006)**
> 
> Jury deliberations took about three hours.
> 
> A federal jury has convicted Kent Hovind and his wife, Jo, of tax fraud.
> 
> Hovind faces a maximum of 288 years in prison. His wife faces up to 225 years. Her charges include aiding and abetting her husband with 44 counts of evading bank-reporting requirements.

And at the end:

> Defense lawyers for the Hovinds rested their case on Wednesday without presenting evidence or calling witnesses.

My question: if the Hovinds weren't going to put on a defense, why didn't they just make a plea bargain agreement, avoid the ordeal of a trial, and get reduced sentences?
