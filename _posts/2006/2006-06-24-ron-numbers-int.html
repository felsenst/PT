<p>In case anyone is interested, there is an <a href="http://www.uwalumni.com/home/onwisconsin/archives/summer2006/faith_in_science.aspx">interview and article with and about Ron Numbers</a>, historian of science and author of <i>The Creationists</i>, available at the U of Wisconsin. He offers a fairly standard perspective on the creationism wars, one that is  commonly expressed here&hellip;but I have to confess, I <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/im_proud_to_be_nonhuman.php">disliked it intensely</a>, and think it represents much that is wrong in the usual conciliatory approach too many people favor.</p>

<p>(Yes! That is an invitation to argue!)</p>
