I was contacted this afternoon by Scott Hechinger, a recruiter for the [New York City Teaching Fellows program](http://www.nycteachingfellows.org/). New York City has a chronic shortage of math and science teachers and they developed this program to help alleviate that shortage. In the last five years, this program has helped 7500 people go through a subsidized Master's Degree program and become math and science teachers, but they need many more. If any of you out there have a bachelor's degree in a math or science related subject and are interested in becoming a teacher, they are [taking applications](http://www.nyctf.org/prospective/apply.html) for the June 2006 class right now. You can get grad school almost entirely paid for and have a job guaranteed when you finish. Not a bad deal. So if anyone is interested, click on over and contact them for more information.
