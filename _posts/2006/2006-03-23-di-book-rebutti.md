I don't know about you, but I can't wait to read [this](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/03/legal_experts_analyze_the_impa.html).  It will be fun to see how many times the previous law review articles by DeWolf et al. (summary: "Intelligent design is constitutional because it is revolutionary new science, not creationism!") are contradicted by the new DI book by DeWolf et al. (which, if it follows the website, will say, "Judge Jones was irresponsible and activist for ruling on the science question!").
