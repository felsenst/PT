It certainly has been a rough few days for disgraced Rev. Ted Haggard, [**quoted by AP/MSNBC as saying**](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15588371/) 


> The fact is I am guilty of sexual immorality. And I take responsibility for the entire problem... I am a deceiver and a liar. There's a part of my life that is so repulsive and dark that I have been warring against it for all of my adult life."

Why mention this on the Thumb?  Because Haggard is also a barnstorming "Goo to you by way of the Zoo"-style creationist.  As proof, I submit this 6-minute YouTube video that looks to be part of Richard Dawkins' BBC television series "[The Root of All Evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Root_of_All_Evil%3F)."  The appearance of Rev. Haggard in this series was mentioned on the Thumb waaaay back on Jan. 12th, 2006 by [commenter Dean Morrison](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/intelligent_des.html#comment-70792).

Anyway, watch this [**6-minute YouTube clip**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmNjfpoRZpE) to see just how really smarmy and oily Haggard can be when he's not trying to explain his sexcapades.
