Dr. Reed and I [are at the University of Washington, Seattle](http://www.dererumnatura.us/archives/2006/06/sleep_deprived.html) this week attending the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics.

Anybody got suggestions for what we can do with our down time?  We are staying on campus and don't have a car.
