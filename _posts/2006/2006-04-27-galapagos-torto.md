Over at the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.naturalhistory.com/) is an online exhibit on [Darwin](http://www.naturalhistory.com/exhibitions/darwin/), that features a [Galapagos tortoise webcam](http://www.naturalhistory.com/exhibitions/darwin/cam/)!  It's rather soothing, the tortoises aren't very speedy. (Hat tip to [Margaret](http://del.icio.us/flipsockgrrl))
