Via Dean and [Science, Just Science](http://justscience.1.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=596&amp;st=0) comes [this story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/5392096.stm) about a new group trying to get ID into class in the UK:

> Parents are being encouraged to challenge their children's science teachers over what they are explaining as the origins of life.
> 
> An organisation called Truth in Science has also sent resource packs to all UK secondary school science departments.
> 
> It promotes the idea of intelligent design - that there was an intelligence behind the creation of the universe.

On their website, Truth in Science notes that they've already sent " a mailing to all Secondary School and College Heads of Science in the United Kingdom."  Busy little bees, aren't they?

And boy, doesn't this sound familiar:

> It quotes the Edexcel examining board as explaining that students "need to adopt a critical, questioning frame of mind, going 'behind the scenes' to understand the workings of science and how it impacts on society and their lives".
> 
> The Truth in Science website says: "We consider that it is time for students to be permitted to adopt a critical approach to Darwinism in science lessons." 

Something sure has evolved:  the anti-evolution catchphrase.  "Critical analysis" and its kin are obviously being positively selected!
