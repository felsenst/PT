<p class="lead">Almost ten years ago, there was a spectacular fossil discovery in China: microfossils, tiny organisms preserved by phosphatization, that revealed <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/10/dissecting_embryos_from_half_a.php">amazing levels of fine detail</a>. These specimens were identified as early animal embryos on the basis of a number of properties.</p>

<ul>
<li>The cells were dimpled and shaped by adjoining cells, suggesting a flexible membrane&mdash;not a cell wall. This rules out algae, fungi, and plants.</li>

<li>The number of cells within each specimen was usually a power of 2. This is something we typically see in cleaving embryos, the sequence from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 cells.</li>

<li>They were <i>big</i>. Typical somatic cells in animals are 5-10 &micro;m in diameter, but ova can be a millimeter or more in diameter, and individual blastomeres (the cells in the cleavage stage embryo) can be several hundred &micro;m across. These cells and the whole assemblage were in that size range.</li>

<li>The individual cells were uniform in size, as seen in many cleavage stage embryos, and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/beauty_in_a_speck_of_dust.php">contained organelles arranged in a consistent pattern</a>.</li>

<li>They were often found encapsulated in a thin membrane, similar to the protective membrane around embryos.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are some concerns about the interpretation, though. One troubling aspect of their distribution is that they are all only in the cleavage stage: we don't see any gastrulas, the stage at which embryonic cells undergo shape changes and begin to move in a specific, directed manner. Studies of taphonomy (analyses of the processes that lead to fossilization) have shown that <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/taphonomy_of_fossilized_embryo.php">these later stages are particularly difficult to preserve</a>, which potentially explains why we're seeing a biased sample. Another unusual bias in the sample is that all of the embryos exhibit that regularity of division that produces equal-sized blastomeres&mdash;yet many <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/spiral_cleavage.php">invertebrate embryos have early asymmetric cleavages</a> that produce recognizable, stereotyped distributions of cells. That asymmetry could be a feature that evolved late, but at the same time, some of the fossils were described as <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/polar_lobes_and_trefoil_embryo.php">resembling molluscan trefoil embryos</a>. Why aren't the examples of early asymmetry translated into a later asymmetry?</p>

<p>Now there's another reason to question the identity of the Doushantuo microfossils: they may be bacterial.</p>
