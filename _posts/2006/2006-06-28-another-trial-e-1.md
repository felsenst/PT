It looks like the case of six private school students against the University of California system will go forward to trial, as [reported by Sean Nealon](http://www.pe.com/localnews/southwest/stories/PE_News_Local_H_calvary28.1d3988f.html). The UC system sets course standards for admission, and has not approved certain courses, including biology, offered at the Christian private schools that the students attend. The students claim a violation of free speech and religious rights. The judge hearing arguments on UC's motion to dismiss has said that he is leaning toward sending this one to trial.
