The summer 2006 edition of [Stanford Medical Magazine](http://mednews.stanford.edu/stanmed/2006summer/) has devoted their issue to "The evolutionary war."  Being the alumni magazine of a medical school, of course they have an article on ["Darwin in medical school."](http://mednews.stanford.edu/stanmed/2006summer/evolutionary-medicine.html)  It's a nice overview, discussing a bit of the history of "Darwinian medicine" and the pros and cons of teaching it in an already over-scheduled medical school curriculum.
