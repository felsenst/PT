There has been some recent news in SC concerning the attempts at inserting creationist language into the science curriculum.  I have hesitated to report them here previously, because taken separately they are mostly minor incidents, but taken together, they tell a story.  I have three posts up on my blog, in chronological order, consisting of good news and bad news (mostly good, I think):

[A Small Victory, But We'll Take It](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/05/small-victory-but-well-take-it.html)

[More on the Death of S114](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/05/more-on-death-of-s114.html)

[Update on the Budget Proviso and the EOC](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/05/update-on-budget-proviso-and-eoc.html)

Also, check out the [South Carolinians for Science Education](http://www.sc-scied.org/EE/index.php) page, as they've got a blog with news updates and other good tidbits.
