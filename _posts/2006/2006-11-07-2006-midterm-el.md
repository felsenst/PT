This thread is for discussing the 2006 Midterm Election.  Make sure you watch the [Daily Show's Midwestern Midterm Midtacular](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml) series (archives available on the Comedy Central website, 1 hour special tonight) to get in the right frame of mind.

It will be interesting to watch the results, because there is a fair bit of evidence that politicians have been running from "intelligent design" this year, at least when they are trying to appeal to voters in the middle (get-out-the-base efforts, e.g. phone calls to likely supporters, seem to be different). 

And the press has been paying attention in a number of races.  See the [NCSE news summary on Kansas](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2006/KS/600_evolution_education_still_a_fa_11_1_2006.asp), and the story about the Ohio Board of Election race between Deborah Owens-Fink and challenger Tom Sawyer: "[Evolution Debate at Center of Ohio Board of Education Race](http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/stephens102606.html)."  There is little polling for such elections, and voter turnout is typically very low for (a) midterm elections and (b) local races.  So it is very hard to predict how things will turn out.

State-wide races are also important to watch -- notably, Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum is facing a tough challenge, and has been running from ID ever since the _Kitzmiller v. Dover_ loss (before that, he was the biggest friend the ID movement had in Congress).  The issue has also come up in Michigan and dozens of other states.

I know that the official [Kansas election returns are here](http://www.kssos.org/ent/kssos_ent.html).  But please post links to the returns for other races, news stories on the issue, etc.
