Coturnix over at [Blog Around the Clock](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/) needs help.  His friend Kevin is doing a survey of herps in China and [can't identify a frog](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/08/is_there_a_herpetologist_in_th.php).  (Snakes are his speciality.)  Can anyone here identify it?  Pictures of the unidentified species, along with some known ones, can be found [here](http://s73.photobucket.com/albums/i233/China_Herping/confounding%20amphibian/).
