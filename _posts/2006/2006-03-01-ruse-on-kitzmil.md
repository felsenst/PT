There is a short list of people whose written opinions on _Kitzmiller v. Dover_ I am particularly interested in seeing.  One of them was Michael Ruse, whose review of the decision was [just published](http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=597) in this month's issue of [_Science & Spirit_ magazine](http://www.science-spirit.org/index.php). 

**Michael Ruse (2005).  "[Two Cheers for Darwin](http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=597)."  _Science & Spirit_, March/April 2006.**

Ruse was the philosopher of science in the famous 1981 _McLean v. Arkansas_ case where "creation science" was declared unconstitutional.  As we went through the trial in _Kitzmiller_, the historical resonances between the two cases became more and more pronounced -- and that was before Robert Gentry pitched up in Harrisburg in the last week of the trial.  

Ruse approves in particular of the philosophy of science in Judge Jones's opinion.  Reading between the lines I think he is giving Rob Pennock a big compliment for threading the needle between being too "demarcationist" (which is what Ruse was accused of, unfairly in my view, by another philosopher, Larry Laudan, in an [article](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0162-2439%28198223%297%3A41%3C16%3ACSATBF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F) which ID/creationists have quoted hundreds of times since -- see also [Ruse's reply](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0162-2439%28198223%297%3A41%3C19%3ARTTCPJ%3E2.0.CO%3B2-0)), while also not falling into the "anything goes" trap that many vehement anti-demarcationists end up with.
