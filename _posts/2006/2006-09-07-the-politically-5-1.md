For my contribution to the ongoing review of Jonathan Wells' new book The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design (PIGDID), I will be reviewing chapters four and five. Chapter Four covers the record of evolution that is contained in the DNA of all living things, and Chapter Five discusses speciation. A full review of each of these chapters is going to take a while and wind up being rather long. I've divided the reviews up into chunks, and I'm going to post each chunk as I finish it. Comments are more than welcome, and might be helpful when the time comes to pull all the separate chunks together into a single document.

I'm going to start off with Chapter 5, which Wells has titled _The Ultimate Missing Link_. This chapter is nominally about speciation, which can be defined as the formation of new species from old ones. This is my own field of study, and I'm relatively current with the literature and what's going on in the field. Reading Wells' version of speciation, I was appalled. His description and criticism bears absolutely no resemblance to the field I study, and his presentation is packed with distortions and outright lies. In future parts of this review, I will discuss some of the _real_ science involved in the study of speciation. In this part of the review, I am going to focus on three examples of places in Chapter Five where Wells lies to his readers. I do not use the word "lie" lightly here. The statements in question are not merely incorrect; they are statements that Wells must have known to be incorrect when he made them.
