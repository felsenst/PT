I hate to give my English brother-in-law something to crow about, but a December 7 article in the _Guardian_, "Ministers to ban creationist teaching aids in science lessons," by James Randerson, gives him ample opportunity.  According to the article,

> The government is to write to schools telling them that controversial teaching materials promoting creationism should not be used in science lessons. 
> 
> The packs include DVDs and written materials promoting intelligent design, a creationist alternative to Darwinism, that were sent to every school in the country by the privately-funded group Truth in Science. Advocates of the theory argue that some features of the universe and nature are so complex that they must have been designed by a higher intelligence. Last week, the Guardian revealed that 59 schools had told Truth in Science the materials were a "useful classroom resource".
