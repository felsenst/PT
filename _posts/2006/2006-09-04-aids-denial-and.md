Regular readers are very familiar with my refrain that many science deniers use the same tactics:  bad arguments, quote-mining, appeals to authority, castigation of originators of respective theories, etc. etc.  Another common thread is the complete bastardization of statistical analysis.  Mark Chu-Carroll elaborates on Peter Duesberg's misuse of statistics [here](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/09/pathetic_statistics_from_hivai.php), while mathematician John Allen Paulos destroys creationist/ID analysis [here](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2384584&amp;page=1).  I'll highlight some of the best parts [at Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/09/aids_denial_and_creationismcom.php#more).
