Finally, an IDist has actually come out and proposed an ID model.  [Read it here](http://www.ibri.org/RRs/RR056/56angels.html).  It is a version of Richard Hoppe's [Multiple Designers Theory](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Multiple+Designers+Theory%22&amp;btnG=Search), but admirably more specific.  Note that the author, Robert Newman, is not some random internet wacko, he is a [longtime contributor](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22robert+newman%22%2C+%22intelligent+design%22&amp;btnG=Search) to the ID literature.
