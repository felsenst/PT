I have frequently commented that intelligent design (ID) is bad theology.  Equally often, I am challenged by someone who will point out that ID may be bad theology from _my_ point of view, while it might be good theology from someone else's point of view.  This is a very valid objection to what I have said, though I will defend the basic point.  ID could be more correctly termed "theology done badly" than "bad theology."

Nonetheless, since ID is being supported primarily by Christians, and evangelical Christians at that, it can be quite properly called "bad theology" as well, because it is bad theology within what is supposed to be the theological framework of most of its supporters.  If you are wondering why there is a split amongst conservative Christians over ID, it is simply that many conservative Christians are saying either that this does not prove or that it is not even trying to prove anything that actually works within their theology.

In talking to Christian groups, I frequently find people who are shocked that I don't support ID.  "How can you not believe the universe is designed?" they ask.  My answer is that I don't accept ID precisely because I believe that the universe is designed.  However it is disguised, however many chapters of mathematical formulas are provided, however many pious statements are made (whenever someone is not trying to pretend this is not theology), ID does not prove, and is not attempting to prove that the universe is designed.  It is, in fact, attempting to prove that some elements are more designed than others, i.e. when we deal with specified complexity as a test of design, it means that we distinguish things that could happen randomly, and things that happen by design.  Right or wrong, evangelical Christians are generally very uncomfortable with things that happen randomly.  They are not looking for Paley's watch on the seashore to prove that the _watch_ is designed, but rather to prove that _everything_ is designed.
