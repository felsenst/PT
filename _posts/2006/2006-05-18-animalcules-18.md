A new edition of [Animalcules](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/02/announcing_new_blog_carnival_1.php), the carnival of all things microbial, is up [at Aetiology.](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/05/post_22.php)  Lots of good posts, including one on endogenous retroviruses that may be of particular interest to the group here.
