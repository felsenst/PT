<img src="http://www.pullenins.com/images/NV.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;" />Apparently the petition to amend the Nevada constitution to include various creationist objections to evolution is going to die for lack of signatures.  Petition author Steve Brown, a Las Vegas masonry contractor, has stopped the signature gathering effort a week before the June 20 deadline.  See the [NCSE news story](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/news/2006/NV/889_nevada_antievolution_ballot_me_6_12_2006.asp) for more.  Hat tip to [Red State Rabble](http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2006/06/nevada-id-initiative-halted.html).

If you haven't seen the [text (PDF)](http://www.sos.state.nv.us/nvelection/int_ref/TruthInScience.pdf) of the petition, I have posted it below the fold.  It is...unique in several ways:

Nevada&apos;s Truth in Science petition wrote:

They must be informed that there are scientists who argue that nowhere in the fossil record is there an indisputable skeleton of a transitional specie, or a "missing link". They insist that the fossil record only shows species that are fully developed
> 
> 5. Students must be informed that some scientists argue that sexual reproduction would require an unbelievable series of chance events that would have had to occur in the evolutionary theory. The students must be informed that the origin of sex, or sex drive, is one of biology's mysteries.

Does sexual reproduction require an unbelievable series of chance events?  Teach the controversy!
