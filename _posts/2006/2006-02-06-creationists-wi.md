So, I watched the SuperBowl last night (mandatory, I think, 'cause the Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger is from my tiny little hometown) and saw [this FedEx commercial](http://fedex.com/us/about/unitedstates/advertising/tvads/stickwm.html?link=4), which has humans living amongst T. rexes and pterodactyls. Can't wait to see this  posted on Answers in Genesis as more proof that people are increasingly being swayed to the "truth" of their message--and during the biggest television event of the year, no less!  They're probably being showered with donations to their [Creation museum](http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/) even as I write.
