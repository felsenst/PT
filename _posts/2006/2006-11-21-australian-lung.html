<p class="lead">I just received word from Per Ahlberg that the status of the <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/the_neoceratodus_campaign.php">Australian lungfish conservation efforts</a> have reached a critical phase: letters are needed NOW. Here's the situation:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Traveston Dam proposal has moved into a new and critically important phase: it has been referred to the Federal Environment Minister (Mr Ian Campbell) for consideration under the Federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Ian Campbell has the power to stop the dam, but if he doesn't it is unlikely that any other organisation or individual will be able to do so.</p>

<p>The first hurdle that must be crossed in order to stop the dam is to ensure that the Minister does not allow the Queensland Government to conduct the EPBC assessment of it's own proposal - something that he is entitled to do. This would be a recipy for disaster as they would be certain to conclude that their own proposal is environmentally sound! The assessment must be carried out by the Federal Environment Ministry to ensure a proper process.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.savethemaryriver.com/">Save the Mary River Campaign</a>  is asking supporters to write to  Mr Campbell and a number of relevant senators to demand a proper assessment, and provides some very helpful information and instructions. This is URGENT: letters have to be received before 27 November.</p></blockquote>
