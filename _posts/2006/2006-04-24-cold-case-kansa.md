The Douglas County Sheriff is closing [the case of Mirecki's beating](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/apr/24/no_new_information_reported_beating/?city_local) because they can't find any leads.

> The trail has gone cold in the investigation of a roadside beating reported late last year by a Kansas University professor.
> 
> Douglas County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Lt. Kari Wempe said Thursday that detectives had finished their paperwork related to religious studies professor Paul Mirecki's report that he was beaten by two unknown men on Dec. 5, 2005, on a roadside south of Lawrence.
> 
> The office has not identified any suspects and, unless any new leads come in, the investigation is finished.
> 
> At the time, Mirecki was under fire for comments he had posted online critical of organized religion.

Now back when Mirecki was assaulted some pundits claimed that he had staged the beating.  Given that the case has closed without any charges filed, it would appear that those pundits owe Mirecki an apology.

Hopefully, Pianka and the Texas Academy of Science are still watching their backs.
