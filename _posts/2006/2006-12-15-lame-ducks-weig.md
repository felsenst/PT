It looks like the lame ducks in Washington have decided to issue [an opinion]( http://www.souder.house.gov/sitedirector/~files/IntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf) and [an appendix]( http://www.souder.house.gov/sitedirector/~files/AppendixtoReportIntoleranceandthePoliticizationofScienceattheSmithsonian.pdf) accusing the Smithsonian of discriminating against Sternberg and politicizing science.  That's right; anti-evolution politicians are accusing _the Smithsonian_ of being the one responsible for politicizing science.  It comes as no surprise that [the media complaints division is on the story.](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/12/the_house_government_reform_su.html)  Expect WorldNet Daily and other reputable news organizations to run with the story.

The opinion was prepared by congressional staff and was commissioned by Congressman Mark Souder, the chairman of the subcommittee on criminal justice, drug policy, and human resources, and who in 2000 co-hosted a Discovery Institute briefing on intelligent design aimed at persuading congress that ID needed political support.  Soon after the briefing, he even read a defense of ID, given to him by the Discovery Institute, into the congressional record.  On his website you can find [the typical pedestrian arguments](http://www.souder.house.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsCenter.Articles&amp;ContentRecord_id=D0A5C8E1-7E9C-9AF9-786E-88E9855F480B)  [against evolution](http://www.souder.house.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsCenter.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=DD9748B8-7E9C-9AF9-7CED-AF71125D7D9B).

So it comes as no surprise that the staff of this friend of the DI has decided that the Smithsonian violated Sternberg's rights and that new laws need to be passed to establish affirmative action for anti-evolutionists.  Because, according to them, judging anti-evolutionists on the merit of their views of science is discrimination.  Next they'll be telling us that Los Alamos should hire people who have doubts about gravity.

Yawn.  Can't they come up with anything original after their devastating loss in Dover?
