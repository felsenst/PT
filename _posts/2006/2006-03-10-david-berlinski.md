Over [on the "ID the Future" blog](http://www.idthefuture.com/2006/03/an_interview_with_david_berlin_1.html), they are posting David Berlinski's interview with himself.  Interestingly, Berlinski doesn't fare well:

> **... Mr. Berlinski, you have frequently been accused of being a crank, someone more generally participating in what has come to be called crank science. I know that ...**
> 
> **DB:** So?
> 
> **... Well, is the accusation one that you accept? ...**
> 
> **DB:** Sure. It's obviously true in essence, although I prefer to describe myself as an iconoclast, one whom history will vindicate ...
> 
> **... No doubt ...**
> 
> **DB:** But the point is the same, whatever the terms. But speaking of terms, maybe I spoke too soon. Look, it's one thing to say that someone like me is a crank. That's fine because it's true. It's quite another thing to talk about crank science.
> 
> **... Surely crank science is what cranks do? ...**
> 
> **DB:** Surely. \[snip -- [read the rest](http://www.idthefuture.com/2006/03/an_interview_with_david_berlin_1.html) and decide for yourself if there is an actual point to all this somewhere.\]

This might be an obscure in-joke or something, and Berlinski is actually being incredibly sophisticated and ironic (or just pretentious -- take your pick). But with Berlinski, as with antievolutionists generally, parody is often impossible to distinguish from reality.
