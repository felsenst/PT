There is good news for those who wanted a copy of _Why Intelligent Design Fails_, but were protective of their wallets and pocketbooks. Rutgers University Press now has the popular Matt Young and Taner Edis anthology [available in paperback](http://165.230.98.36/acatalog/____1147.html), at a sale price of $19.96. Yes, there is sales tax to be added, but there's free shipping for web orders. I paid more for dinner at the AAAS conference hotel restaurant.

Be sure to check out [Taner Edis's page on WIDF](http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/books/id/), which links to reviews.
