This should have happened last week, but longtime PT contributor and author of the much-beloved ["The Quixotic Message", or "No Free Hunch"](http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/hunch/hunch.html), and also the equally beloved [Quixotic References](http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/hunch/IDnotes.html), formerly known as theyeti, and catcher of [broadheaded skinks](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/friday-animal-blogging_14.html) and [legless glass lizards](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/friday-animal-blogging.html), [mild critic of hydrogen as an alternative fuel](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/why-hydrogen-is-stupid.html), **HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED HIS PHD!!!** (although he somehow [lost his original post announcing this](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-hell.html)).  He somehow managed to do this while writing [all of these great PT posts](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=site:www.pandasthumb.org+%22posted+by+steve+reuland%22), including classics like [Phillip Johnson's Bold Stand](/archives/2004/07/phillip-johnson-1.html) and [Phillip Johnson's Bold Stand, Redux](/archives/2004/10/phillip-johnson-2.html).

More importantly, Steve can now finally achieve his true reason for getting a PhD, which was to join [the list](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3697_the_list_2_16_2003.asp) of [Project Steve](Project Steve) Steves.

I don't actually know what Reuland's PhD was about, something biomedical I think, but for now I think I will assume it had something to do with getting [ Sunbeams From Cucumbers](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/).
