I haven't been terribly active in the blogging world lately, but today, I _break my silence_.

On my blog, I had a bit of fun with the sad story of Dembski's anonymous victim [here](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/05/those-nasty-persecutors.html).  And I wrote a slightly longer and more serious post in response to one by Salvador Cordova [here](http://stevereuland.blogspot.com/2006/05/how-to-really-detect-design.html) about a company that supposedly "detects design".  Comments may be left there.  Enjoy!
