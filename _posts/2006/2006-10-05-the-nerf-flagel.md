<img src="http://www.ianjuby.org/images/flagella.gif" alt="" style="float:left;" />I want one of these for Christmas.  Courtesy of [Display #1: The Bacterial Flagellum](http://www.ianjuby.org/tour1.html), at the [Creation Science Museum of Canada](http://www.ianjuby.org/tourindex.html).  Watch out, evolutionists, you have been judged on the [Hogwash-O-Meter](http://www.ianjuby.org/images/hogwashmeterred.jpg) and found wanting!  If that doesn't convince you, just look at the [tracks of humans found with dinosaur tracks at Paluxy](http://www.ianjuby.org/tour10.html).
