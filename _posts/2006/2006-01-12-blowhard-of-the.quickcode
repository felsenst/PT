I recently had the misfortune to stumble on a really revolting corner of the web, the not-so-modestly-named <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com">DavidWarrenOnline</A>.  Warren appears to be a journalist, and for the <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/index.html"><i>Ottawa Citizen</i></a>, no less -- a newspaper that, back when Peter Calamai worked there, was sometimes worth reading.  Judging from their employment of Mr. Warren, however, the <i>Citizen</i> has sunk into a swamp from which it will not soon recover.

Explore that website and you will find the very worst sort of ignorant bigotry:  screeds against <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?artID=445">gay marriage</a>, <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?artID=545">global warming</a>, and (big surprise) evolution, all served up with a really insufferable helping of religious smugness.  And the writing!  I was raised by newspaper reporters, who never missed an opportunity to tell me how my writing could be improved.  But it appears Mr. Warren received no similar assistance.  His columns frequently wander and maunder, heading this way and that, but never actually arriving anywhere.  Who in their right mind would give this supercilious dolt a <i>weekly</i> column?    

If you, too, want to suffer as much as I did, you can start with four of Mr. Warren's columns about evolution.  In his <a href="http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?artID=426">December 29 2004 column</a> about <i>Homo floresiensis</i>,  he reveals his doubts that it is a new species of the genus <i>Homo</i>.  Informed doubt would be welcome, but Mr. Warren's doubts aren't based on anything more scientific than the fact that he once saw a woman in Calcutta about the same weight "and only slightly taller" than <i>H. floresiensis</i>.  He then reveals that he suspects <i>all</i> hominid species are just varieties of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and quotes one of his readers as saying, "Evolution? Probably a pile of crap. It seems to spring from the same faulty thinking reservoir as Marxism and other failed ideological constructs of the early 20th century."  Dee-lightful!
