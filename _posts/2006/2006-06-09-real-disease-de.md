I wrote recently how evolution and phylogenetic analysis of HIV isolates has provided evidence that [the progenitor to HIV jumped into humans in Cameroon](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/06/origins_of_hiv.php) or a nearby area.  Obviously it's a topic that's interesting to me, but may seem a bit esoteric to some.  RPM over at [Evolgen](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen) has a new post showing [another application of phylogenetic analysis to HIV](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/06/phylogeny_friday_9_june_2006_1.php) that may be of interest to readers here, where infectious disease epidemiology meets CSI.
