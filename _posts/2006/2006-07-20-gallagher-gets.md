The name "Richard Gallagher" may be familiar to some readers.  Gallagher is the editor of [The Scientist](http://www.the-scientist.com/), and last year, somewhat naively suggested that the evolution/creation "debate" was actually a good thing (you can find the text of his editorial [at this site](http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2005/08/intelligent-design-and-informed-debate.html)).  Both [PZ](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/what_was_he_thinking/) and [Jason Rosenhouse](http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/this-is-depressing.html) took him to task for the editorial (and Gallagher replied, and [PZ shot back](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/gallagher_distortions_and_dishonesty/)).  The next month, New Scientist then published a number of letters responding to the editorial, and Gallagher also wrote a reply (republished [here](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2518) by the Discovery Institute).  Gallagher ended that piece with this quote:

> Critical thinking has no place in science class? Really? That bodes incredibly poorly for the future of science teaching. We're shelving our best weapon against intelligent design, and I find it incredibly sad that scientists who support evolution so strongly would have us shield growing young minds from the "dangers" of critical thinking.
> 
> If that's not dogma, I don't know what is.

...which of course doesn't really address the arguments PZ and Jason had put forth--no one wants to "shield minds" from critical thinking at all.  

So, of course it's a bit depressing to see an editor of a life science magazine make strawman mischaracterizations of his fellow scientists who approach the issue differently (and, perhaps, have spent a bit more time in the trenches than Gallagher has).  But Gallagher's editorial in the July issue (["Zealots for Science"](http://www.the-scientist.com/2006/7/1/13/1/)) makes me think that, maybe, hopefully, he's starting to get it.
