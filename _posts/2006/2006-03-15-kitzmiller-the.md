...because paramount has apparently got [a serious scriptwriter signed up to do _Kitzmiller v. Dover_: the movie](http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13642).

It will be interesting to see how this turns out.  I tend to think the only way to make Dover into a watchable movie would be to basically do an _Inherit the Wind_ remake, which would require some substantial rewriting because the plaintiffs were parents, rather than the defendant being a teacher.  But on the other hand, the poor teachers in Dover were pretty seriously oppressed by William Buckingham et al., so it might work.

In other news, _Nova_ is doing a documentary on _Kitzmiller v. Dover_, which will apparently include some remakes of courtroom scenes.

Everyone has already decided that Tom Hanks should play Judge Jones...
