While the scientific vacuity of Intelligent Design has been well documented, it does not hurt to show how Intelligent Design compares to evolutionary science. 


> NEW LONDON, Conn. - Phillip Barnes, associate professor of biology at Connecticut College, will explore the nature of science by contrasting evolutionary biology with intelligent design in a free and public lecture on Thursday, April 20, at 4:30 p.m. in Room 014 of the F.W. Olin Science Center.
> 
> His talk, "Evolution and Intelligent Design," will include a discussion of the predictive power of the science of evolution "and its relevance for setting public policy in the potential avian flu epidemic, while intelligent design provides no relevant predictions or information for public policy," Barnes said. Time for questions and discussion will follow.
