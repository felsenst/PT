William Dembski recently posted <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/archives/1708">this amusing post</a> on the subject of Groupthink.  He provided a list of eight indicators that people are showing evidence of Groupthink, and said, &ldquo;Read the following and ask yourself which side in the ID vs. Darwinism debate exhibits the groupthink syndrome:&rdquo;

Since I had some free time today, I decided to take him up on his challenge.  My findings are <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2006/10/dembski_on_groupthink.php">posted here</a>.  Comments can be left over at EvolutionBlog.  Enjoy!
