The Panda's Thumb went live on March 23rd, 2004. Back on September 12th, 2005, Panda's Thumb celebrated its one millionth user visit. Today, one of you tipped the counter to give PT its two millionth visit. 

In between the first and second million mark, you have come to PT to get the latest on happenings in the "Waterloo In Dover", the _Kitzmiller v. DASD_ court case that now informs school board policies and has proven so useful in educating the media. The recently settled lawsuit in El Tejon, California demonstrated that nicely. Whether you have a preference for digestion or development, PT contributors have also helped keep you informed on recently published findings from the scientific literature. And, of course, our Professor Steve Steve keeps turning up with interesting news, like the finding of a pre-Cambrian chordate, and meeting fascinating people.

So we hope that you will keep coming back to visit, and we will keep working on providing timely news and commentary on evolutionary biology and the religiously-motivated antievolution efforts to deny or diminish its teaching in the public schools.
