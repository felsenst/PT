Over at Uncommon Descent, Salvdor Cordova offers <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1220">this amusing essay</a> about why ID is a far more useful framework than evolution for scientific research.  I'm sure everyone will be shocked to learn that his argument is, well, not correct.  I've posted <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2006/06/cordova_steps_in_it.html">a full reply</a> over at <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog">EvolutionBlog</a>.  Comments can be left there.  Enjoy!
