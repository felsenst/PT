Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, [has died](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/09/04/1157222051588.html) while filming stingrays at Batt Reef in Australia.

> But after years of close shaves it was a normally harmless stingray which finally claimed his life on Monday, plunging a barb into the Crocodile Hunter's chest as he snorkelled in shallow water on the Great Barrier Reef.
