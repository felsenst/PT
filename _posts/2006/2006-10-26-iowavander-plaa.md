I mentioned the situation with Lieutenant Governor candidate Bob Vander Plaats and his support of intelligent design last week (posts [here](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/10/iowa_lieutenant_governor_candi.php) and [here](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/10/worse_than_i_thought_in_iowa.php)).  A group of us have put together an editorial discussing Vander Plaats' position and why it matters to Iowa voters (letter and signatories can be found [here](http://www.iowascience.org/?p=28) at the Iowa Citizens for Science site).  Yesterday, a columnist for the Des Moines register [also wrote up the story, and our response to it:](http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061025/OPINION01/610250335/1035/OPINION)
