Dear everybody,

I have braved the intellectual desert that is philosophy in order to bring enlightenment to these poor philosophers of science at the Philosophy of Science Association conference in Vancouver. I allowed the lovely Janet Stemwedel to host my report and the photos she took of me instructing various people in the real truth about science. 

[Here ](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/11/a_pandaseye_view_of_the_psa.php)is me avoiding that Wilkins guy and having fun, before it went downhill, as these things do, but it has some famous philosophers (if that's not a contradiction in terms) with me. And [here ](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/11/panda_and_philosophers_meet_pa.php)is some more of me with other philosophers, who are only famous to other philosophers. That Wilkins guy keeps getting into the shot, though, so close one eye to avoid seeing him.
