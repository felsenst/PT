Cobb County](http://www.ncseweb.org/selman/)_?  You remember, the one that ended by citing a Supreme Court decision, only the Supreme Court in question was the Supreme Court of India?  Well, you're in luck, because I just came across an [article by Meera Nanda](http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127003309700.htm) on Vedic creationists and the alliance they've formed with the more traditional conservative evangelical creationists here the U.S.  I'd pay good money to see these two groups in the same room with Harun Yahya...
