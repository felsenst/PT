I have written a comprehensive fisking of the Discovery Institute's absolutely laughable "study" (yes, these people really do believe that using the word count function in a word processor is a "study"; no wonder they can't put any actual scientific research) at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/fisking_the_dis_study_on_the_d.php). Comments may be left there.
