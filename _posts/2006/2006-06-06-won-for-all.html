<p class="lead">Last night, I <i>had</i> to read this book <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/05/michael_ashburner_1.php">RPM</a> mentioned. It's not very long&mdash;about 100 pages, counting a preface, an epilogue, and an afterward, and it has lots of pictures&mdash;but be warned: it's very inside baseball.</p>

<p>The book is <i>Won for All: How the Drosophila Genome Was Sequenced</i><sup><span style="font-size: 9px;">(<a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0879698020/pharyngula-20" target="_new" title="buy this book at amazon">amzn</a>/<a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;bfpid=0879698020&amp;bfmtype=book" target="_new" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;noble">b&amp;n</a>/<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0879698020&cm_ven=CJ&amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" target="_new" title="buy this book at abebooks">abe</a>/<a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn=0879698020" target="_new" title="buy this book at Powells">pwll</a>)</span></sup> by Michael Ashburner, and its subject is the rush to sequence the <i>Drosophila</i> genome in 1998-1999. It's a rather strange twist on what I expected, though. While the subtitle says "How the Drosophila Genome Was Sequenced," there is almost no science at all in the body of the book; instead, it's all about the people and the politics, with Ashburner flitting about from place to place, yelling at people and eating sushi. It's phenomenally entertaining.</p>
