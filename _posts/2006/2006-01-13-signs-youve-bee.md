You've spent so many hours asking your creationist friends to define a "kind," or explaining why the "tornado in a junkyard" or "watchmaker" analogies are hopelessly flawed, that you're beginning to see flagella and mousetraps in your sleep.  I mean, look at [poor Nick.](/archives/2006/01/kenneth-miller.html)  Kid can't even hear the word "truthiness" without having visions of IDists dancing in his head.  I caught myself doing this today, too. 

I listen to a lot of country music.  (Yeah, yeah, go ahead and mock.  I'm used to it).  Couple that with 1) the fact that I live in Iowa, where there's a \*lot\* of country radio, and 2) the fact that my car didn't have a CD player,  that meant lots of time on the road tuned in to a country station.  As a mom (aka taxi), that means the kids also spent a lot of time listening to it--and my daughter's favorite song of the past year was Faith Hill's "Mississippi Girl."  So, we bought her Faith's new CD for Christmas.  

(Yes, there is a point to this--see over at  [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/01/signs_youve_been_involved_in_t.php))
