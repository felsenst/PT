Panda's Thumb made it into the finals for "Best Blog Community" in the Koufax Awards. It would be nice if there were [at least one vote registered for PT in the final round vote](http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002508.html). And have a look at the other final round votes, too, while you are at it.
