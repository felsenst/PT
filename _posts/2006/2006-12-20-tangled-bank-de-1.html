<p class="lead">A <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">Tangled Bank</a> is a good spot from which to launch an ambush&mdash;so <a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/12/tangled-bank-69-war-on-christmas.html">Salto Sobrius is on the attack</a>!</p>


<p>P.S. Scienceblogs had a server upgrade last night that has gone awry. Everything still looks fine, but the backend is a mess, and you won't be able to make any comments, and we won't be able to make any new entries, until it is all repaired&hellip;which will be shortly, we hope.</p>

<p>P.P.S. "Shortly" means it seems to have already been fixed. Hooray!</p>
