I think it's an excellent case of some true "alternative explanations" for the data that the creationist/ID types often crow about.  

Creationists often try to validate their position by saying that both they and mainstream scientists start from the same data, but that creationists use their "Bible glasses" to interpret it, while scientists view it through their "evolution glasses."  In other words, they're not wrong--it's just a different interpretation of the same data, and where you end up depends on your initial biases and worldview.  Though this is bogus when it comes to creationism, there are indeed real debates in the literature, where two hypotheses may be similarly compelling.
