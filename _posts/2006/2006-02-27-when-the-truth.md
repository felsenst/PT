Intelligent Design activists [seem to be upset](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/02/orlando_sentinel_suppresses_ac.html#more) with the Media for [point ing out that intelligent design requires a supernatural designer](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/broward/sfl-ctextbook24feb24,0,1286953.story?coll=sfla-news-broward), "or other guiding force". That ID proponents have spent much effort to disguise this foundational principle has been well-documented. Thus when ID activists claim that ID 

> ...  merely proposes that there is good evidence that some features of nature--like the intricate molecular motors within cells and the finely-tuned laws of physics--are best explained as the products of an intelligent cause, not chance and necessity. Whether this intelligent cause identified through the scientific method is (or is not) "god" cannot be answered by the science alone and is therefore outside the scope of the theory of intelligent design. 

the media aa well as the judge in the Dover case have found these claims without much merrit.

West, faced with an uncooperative media, decided to send of a letter to the newspaper complaining about using 'inaccurate descriptions' of Intelligent Design (by refusing to accept ID's definition and instead looking at the logical consequences of ID's claims). Worse, the editors, according to West,  'surpressed a more accurate description'.... Not to mention the use of the pejorative  'watering down' when describing ID's efforts. And yet,  the judge ruled that

> Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.

ID, by raising mostly irrelevant objections to evolutionary theory (see for example Icons of Evolution) is trying to water down evolutionary theory. Lest people are confused what drives ID proponents to 'teach the controversy', let me [quote West](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/571)

> John West, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, said he considered the revisions a victory for his group. The revisions in Glencoe and Holt books are tantamount to an admission by "Darwinists" that evolution theory is flawed, he said. "This vindicates us."

Indeed, the goal seems to not be to strengthen evolutionary theory but rather to suggest that Darwinian theory is flawed. And yet, West is surprised when the media describes the efforts as 'watering down' evolution.

It may be helpful for the reader to be reminded of the 'arguments' by ID activists which lead to the inevitable conclusion that ID is all about the supernatural, although given the recent 'successes in the courts', it should not come as a surprise that ID activist have tried unnusccesfully to 'divorce' ID from its religious foundations.

And people wonder why so many are starting to realize that Intelligent Design is scientifically vacuous.

It suffices to point out that the Judge in the Kitzmiller v Dover case found that an objective observer would know that Intelligent Design is all about God (wink wink)

> An Objective Observer Would Know that ID and Teaching About "Gaps" and "Problems" in Evolutionary Theory are Creationist, Religious Strategies that Evolved from Earlier Forms of Creationism

Replacing God with the term intelligent design(er) makes no difference as the history of ID shows that this designer is simply God. 

> We initially note that John Haught, a theologian who testified as an expert witness for Plaintiffs and who has written extensively on the subject of evolution and religion, succinctly explained to the Court that the argument for ID is not a new scientific argument, but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God.

This designer is clearly supernatural as it works outside the laws of nature and science.

> In fact, an explicit concession that the intelligent designer works outside the laws of nature and science and a direct reference to religion is Pandas' rhetorical statement, "what kind of intelligent agent was it \[the designer\]" and answer: "On its own science cannot answer this question. It must leave it to religion and philosophy." (P-11 at 7; 9:13-14 (Haught))

West repeats much of the same 'argument' in his letter

West wrote:

> Whether this intelligent cause identified through the scientific method is (or is not) "god" cannot be answered by the science alone and is therefore outside the scope of the theory of intelligent design.

The most dramatic evidence of ID's religious nature comes from the Discovery Institute's Wedge Document"

> Dramatic evidence of ID's religious nature and aspirations is found in what is referred to as the "Wedge Document." The Wedge Document, developed by the Discovery Institute's Center for Renewal of Science and Culture (hereinafter "CRSC"), represents from an institutional standpoint, the IDM's goals and objectives, much as writings from the Institute for Creation Research did for the earlier creation-science movement, as discussed in McLean.

Even the witnesses for the defense showed how ID is all about the supernatural

> Defendants' expert witness ID proponents confirmed that the existence of a supernatural designer is a hallmark of ID. First, Professor Behe has written that by ID he means "not designed by the laws of nature," and that it is "implausible that the designer is a natural entity." (P-647 at 193; P-718 at 696, 700). Second, Professor Minnich testified that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened so that supernatural forces can be considered. (38:97 (Minnich)). Third, Professor Steven William Fuller testified that it is ID's project to change the ground rules of science to include the supernatural. (Trial Tr. vol. 28, Fuller Test., 20-24, Oct. 24, 2005). Turning from defense expert witnesses to leading ID proponents, Johnson has concluded that science must be redefined to include the supernatural if religious challenges to evolution are to get a hearing. (11:8-15 (Forrest); P-429). Additionally, Dembski agrees that science is ruled by methodological naturalism and argues that this rule must be overturned if ID is to prosper. (Trial Tr. vol. 5, Pennock Test., 32-34, Sept. 28, 2005).

And then the book Pandas and People which showed so clearly why Intelligent Design is nothing more than a repackaged creationism

> The weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from "creation" to "intelligent design" occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme Court's important Edwards decision. This compelling evidence strongly supports Plaintiffs' assertion that ID is creationism re-labeled.

And if ID were scientific how come that ID backers have both avoided scientific scrutiny and have failed to present much of anything related to ID which is scientifically relevant. Worse, ID has repackaged itself as 'teach the controversy', trying to avoid the scrutiny.

> Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.

While the truth may hurt, the fact is that the media has wisened up and is not accepting the Discovery Institute's claims without a critical analysis. Ironically, it seems that the concepts of "teaching the controversy" and "critically analyze" are something to which ID strongly objects when applied to its own claims.
