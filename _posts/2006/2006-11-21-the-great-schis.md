We tend to focus on the ID creationists here at PT, but it is worth remembering that outside of the public policy sphere, in the conservative evangelical subculture, it is still the young-earth creationist ministries that are the dominant players.

All year there have been rumors and speculation about the causes of a breakup between the USA branch of Answers in Genesis, which is sinking a huge amount of money into their Creation Museum, and the Australia branch.  Blogger [Jim Lippard](http://lippard.blogspot.com/) is The Official Expert on all of this, and [today he has The Big Scoop on a whole bunch of new details about the schism](http://lippard.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-from-behind-scenes-of.html).
