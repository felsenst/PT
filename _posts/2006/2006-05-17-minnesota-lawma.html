<p class="lead">It's <a href="http://redstaterabble.blogspot.com/2006/05/minnesota-accept-no-substitutes.html">true</a>: the Minnesota Senate has passed a modification to an education bill that would <a href="http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/bin/bldbill.php?bill=S2994.3.html&session=ls84">prohibit the teaching of intelligent design</a>.</p>

<blockquote><code style="font-size:11px">16.12 Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2004, section 120B.021, is amended by adding a<br />
16.13 subdivision to read:<br />
16.14 Subd. 2a. Curriculum. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Department<br />
16.15 of Education, a charter school, and a school district are prohibited from utilizing a<br />
16.16 nonscientifically based curriculum, such as intelligent design, to meet the required science<br />
16.17 academic standards under this section.

<p>This is not a law yet, and I don't expect it will be. The senate version of the bill has to be reconciled with the house version, and the house version does not include this addendum. It will probably vanish without comment.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about it. It's reasonable to expect that science requirements cannot be met by non-science curricula, and on that principle, the limitation is reasonable. However, I don't like the idea of politicians with little training in the subject trying to dictate what is and isn't science. Just say that a course should address the content specified by the state science standards, which were written by a committee of citizen educators and scientists, rather than trying to specify details by way of legal statutes.</p>

<p>Besides, maybe the intelligent design crowd will get off their butts and do experiments and develop evidence that actually makes their wild-ass guess scientific, and then this law would look awfully silly.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">(Yeah, I'm smirking cynically and laughing as I write that.)</p>
