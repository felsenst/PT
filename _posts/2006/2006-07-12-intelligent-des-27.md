Now it is later and I present: Erik Tellgren, freshly returned from a trip,  who has combined the results for random search and the work by Gavrilet to show

Furthermore, it is stressed that for these fitness landscapes, the absolute performance of evolution is not prohibitively bad, that high-fitness regions tend to be well-connected, and that the difficulty of finding high-fitness regions does not increase with the size of the search space. (PDF format.)

Concluding that:
