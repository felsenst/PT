Moving from physical characteristics--color, bone shape, the form of bacterial cells--to genetic characteristics in order to classify organisms--and infer phylogenies--was a giant advance.  That the molecular characteristics confirmed what was known using physical characteristics was a breakthrough, and allowed for more sophisticated analyses of organisms that don't have bones or other easily-observable physical features that allow for simple classification into groups:  microbes.  I've [previously pointed out](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/05/simple_evolutionary_study_may.php) the utility of phylogenetic analysis in tracking the spread of pathogens.  A [new study on the origin and evolution of HIV](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1126531v1) employs a similar approach in order to elucidate the history of the virus in Africa.
