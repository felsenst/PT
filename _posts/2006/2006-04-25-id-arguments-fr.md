One of the folks at William Dembski's blog has issued a [challenge](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1066). He claims that all of the arguments that we use to establish that ID is substantially the same as creationism are based on false premises (he's wrong about that) and he says:

> Why can't ID opponents focus on the arguments, themselves, and show how they are equivalent to Creationism? If ID really is just repackaged Creationism, why not just expose the arguments for what they are and be done with it?

I take him up on his challenge and show the creationist roots of all of the major ID arguments in a post at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/04/id_arguments_from_creationist_1.php). Comments may be left there.
