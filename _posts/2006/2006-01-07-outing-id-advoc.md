There is a bit of a controversy going on about whether anonymous ID advocates should be "outed". One blog in particular is currently attempting to divine the identity of "MikeGene", a longtime pseudonymous participant in the ID/evolution debate. After discussions with a few other PT contributors, I give my thoughts on this practice at [Dispatches from the Culture Wars](http://www.stcynic.com/blog/archives/2006/01/outing_id_advocates_1.php). Comments may be left there.
