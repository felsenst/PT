It's already been mentioned that the Simpson covered evolution tonight.  However, Family Guy touched on it as well.

> Peter: "Then over millions of years evolution took its course." 
> 
> _A fish is shown emerging from water and changing into a dinosaur._
> 
> Peter: "Of course I'm obligated by the state of Kansas to present the Church's alternative to the theory of evolution." 
> 
> _A genie (ala I Dream of Jeannie) is shown coming from water and poofing into existance a rabbit, a deer, an owl, a bear, a dog, a man, a car, a gas pump, Jesus with a giant "USA #1" foam hand, and Santa Claus._
