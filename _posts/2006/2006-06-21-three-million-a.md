A little while ago Sitemeter recorded PT's three millionth visit. We are seeing a bit of a fall-off in traffic since the _Kitzmiller v. DASD_ case time, as are many sites that deal with the creation/evolution issue. KvD was an extraordinary spur to interest, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness afterward. 

Following the Scopes trial in 1925, popular belief held that the antievolutionists had suffered a defeat and were in retrenchment. This was not so. In the next few years, over twenty other states ~~passed~~proposed legislation similar to Tennessee's Butler Act, with the ~~effect~~intent of banning the teaching of evolutionary biology in public schools in those states.(\*) Two states, Mississippi and Arkansas, actually passed the antievolution measures, making the intent take the force of law.

We need to keep in mind that the anti-science threat has not been rendered impotent by the outcome of the KvD trial. The contributors to PT will continue to keep you informed of developments as we see the new strategies for opposing effective instruction in evolutionary biology emerge.

(\*)Thanks to Nick Matzke for pointing out my error of recall concerning proposed and passed.
