Buttars' crazy anti-evolution bill has been killed in Utah.

> The evolution bill is no more.
> 
> The Utah House of Representatives voted 46-28 to kill SB96, which cast doubt on the teaching of evolution.
> 
> "There are a number of influential legislators who believe you evolved from an ape. I didn't," said Sen. Chris Buttars, R-West Jordan, who sponsored the bill.
> 
> He said it was "doubtful" that he would try a similar bill in the future.
> 
> The bill would have required a teacher to say the state does not endorse evolution and that the controversial theory is not a proven fact before teaching Charles Darwin's ideas.
