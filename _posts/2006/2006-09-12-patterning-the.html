<p class="lead">I'm a little surprised at the convergence of interest in this <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news77211829.html">news report of a conserved mechanism of organizing the nervous system</a>&mdash;I've gotten a half-dozen requests to explain what it all means. Is there a rising consciousness about evo-devo issues? What's caused the sudden focus on this one paper?</p>

<p>It doesn't really matter, I suppose. It's an interesting observation about how both arthropods and vertebrates seem to partition regions along the dorso-ventral axis of the nervous system using exactly the same set of molecules, a remarkable degree of similarity that supports the idea of a common origin. Gradients of a molecule called Bmp may be the primitive mechanism for establishing dorso-ventral polarity in animals.</p>
