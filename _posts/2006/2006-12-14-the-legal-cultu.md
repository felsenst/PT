Larry Moran has [a long post here](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2006/12/lessons-from-culture-wars.html) reflecting on [the DI's portrayal of Judge Jones as a plagiarist.](/archives/2006/12/weekend-at-behe.html) At first, Moran felt that Jones had really done something wrong, but he appears to have taken to heart the explanations [here ](/archives/2006/12/is-john-west-di.html)and [elsewhere](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/fisking_the_dis_study_on_the_d.php) that judges are _expected_to follow the proposed findings of fact of the party whom they find most convincing. It seems like a simple, innocent misunderstanding. But Moran goes on to make comments that seem like criticisms of the legal culture's standards of ethics and "standards of brilliance," that I think deserve some discussion.
