In 2004, Richard von Sternberg was editor of a journal that published a paper by "intelligent design" advocate Stephen C. Meyer. The society that published the journal issued a statement saying that the paper's inclusion had been a mistake, and that they would tighten up the review and acceptance process. Afterward, Sternberg would complain that he was a victim of religious discrimination. Since then, ID advocates have made much of the alleged poor treatment of Sternberg, turning his name into a verb: to be "sternberged", in their view, is to be stripped of "academic freedom", the ability to take unpopular stances and express edgy and even antisocial opinions without fear for one's job and other elements of normal day-to-day living.

That makes it sound like ID advocates are taking a stand for a principle.

But that would be the wrong impression.

"Academic freedom" is just a piece of convenient rhetoric so far as ID advocates are concerned: useful when they feel an ID advocate needs some cover, and trampled on whenever someone in academia says something that they don't like.

Or is claimed by another ID advocate to have said something that they don't like.
