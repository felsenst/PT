Over at Uncommon Descent William Dembski is linking to the [random mutation site](http://www.randommutation.com/darwinianevolution.htm)  with approval. Claiming to be a " Darwinian Evolution Experiment", all it is is a simple random mutation generator. To be "Darwinian", a system has to have selection as well. No selection, as in this case, well, it's a waste of space. So why is Dembski linking to a site that he knows is a attacking a strawman version of evolution? Maybe its a bit of street theatre to distract people from the fact that he is [happy](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1213) with Ann Coulters appalling book, you know, the one where she [falsley accuses honest scientists of fraud](/archives/2006/06/anne-coulter-cl-1.html)?

If you want to see a real Darwinian Evolution Experiment pop over to [Zachriel's Word Mutagenation](http://www.zachriel.com/mutagenation/ )  and [Phrasenation](http://www.zachriel.com/phrasenation/)  pages, where mutation and selection is used. Not only only do you get to evolve plain English words and phrases (the thing that the random mutation site claims you can't do), you get to look at the code and see how it is done!  Extra cool. If you are hankering for an old style Dawkins Weasel program, I maintain an archive[ here](http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/Pharm/Musgrave/essays/whale.htm).
