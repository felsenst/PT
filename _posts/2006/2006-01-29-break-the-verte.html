<p>If you appreciate biodiversity and want to read about organisms other than pet cats, and if you aren't too squeamish about spiky creatures with crunchy carapaces of squishy ones encapsulated in slime, the latest <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/01/circus_of_the_spineless_5_word.php">Circus of the Spineless</a> is just the thing for you. Browse the thumbnails at <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>, and follow through to the critter that appeals to you most. I thought the <a href="http://muton.blogspot.com/2006/01/armoured-snail.html">snail armored in iron sulfide</a> was spectacular, but the <a href="http://budak.blogs.com/the_annotated_budak/2006/01/a_mantispid.html">mantispids</a> are pretty neat, too, and I'll always have a soft spot for the <a href="http://lancelet.blogspot.com/2006/01/squid-brains.html">squid</a>. Oh, and the strange <a href="http://deepseanews.blogspot.com/2006/01/pram-bugs-attack-scottish-shorelines.html">pram bugs that occupy salp tests</a>&hellip;never mind, you need to read them all.</p>
