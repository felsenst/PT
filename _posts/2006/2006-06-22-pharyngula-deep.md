PZ Myers has posted a well written article on [deep homologies in the pharyngeal arches](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/deep_homologies_in_the_pharyng.php) which link the thyroid/parathyroid glands in humans to the gills in fish. 

This is an excellent example of how science contributes to our scientific understanding. Could  someone remind me: How again does Intelligent Design explain all this? 'Poof'?...
