<big>Underground lake, Chapat [Cave](http://www.amazingcaves.com/set_learn_ecology.html), Belize. This lake is the home of cave-adapted fish, crabs, and other life.  Scientists are interested in the hydrology of Chapat Cave, since it is known to flood as much as a hundred feet above the normal level shown here.  The timing and cause of the floods is not yet known.</big>
