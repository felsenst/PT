According to a recent [tally](http://ncse.com/evolution/antievolution-legislation-scorecard) by the ever-vigilant National Center for Science Education, nine anti-science bills have been introduced in various states since January. Most of them use the "critical analysis" ploy, also known as the "strengths and weaknesses" ploy. Some bills specifically state that teachers may not be penalized in any manner for "helping" students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of evolution.  Most recently, the Tennessee House passed a bill that would allow teachers to "help students understand, analyze, critique, and review ... the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories."  By an odd coincidence, the scientific theories with which students evidently need the most help include evolution, global warming, origin of life, and human cloning, just those topics which so bemuse the extreme right. Where, you may ask, is homeopathy or "alternative" medicine, subjects that are desperately in need of critical analysis? Certainly not singled out in any of the bills. You may read more details and find relevant links at the NCSE website.
