<p>_Intelligent design news from the 6th of April to the 13th of April, 2011._</p>


<p>This week was fairly interesting with regards to the online ID movement. However, it wasn't a great week for author diversity. Yes, all the posts I'll be talking about were written by Casey Luskin, everyone's favourite non-scientist attorney. What I want to know is: how does he find the time to write so much? Surely his work asÂ Program Officer in Public Policy & Legal Affairs at the Discovery Institute occupies much of his time, so where does all of this time come from to discuss so many different topics relating to ID? As a full-time student I barely have enough time to scrape this together every week... (And I've been sick and quite busy, which is why this post is a day late, I apologise.)</p>


<p>Anyway, this week's posts are about Lynn Margulis and academic "status", the Tennesse academic freedom bill and language in biology. Let's get into it.</p>
