Mike Lin speaks Tuesday, April 26th at 12pm PST on "Locating
protein-coding sequences under selection for additional, overlapping
functions in 29 mammalian genomes"

The degeneracy of the genetic code allows protein-coding DNA and RNA
sequences to simultaneously encode additional, overlapping functional
elements. A sequence in which both protein-coding and additional
overlapping functions have evolved under purifying selection should
show increased evolutionary conservation compared to typical
protein-coding genes---especially at synonymous sites. We developed a
method to systematically locate short regions within known ORFs that
show conspicuously low estimated rates of synonymous substitution,
based on phylogenetic codon rate models and likelihood ratio tests.

We applied this method to genome alignments of 29 placental mammals,
resulting in more than 10,000 "synonymous constraint elements" (SCEs)
with resolution down to nine-codon windows. These are found within
more than a quarter of all human protein-coding genes and contain ~2%
of their synonymous sites. We collected numerous lines of evidence
that the observed synonymous constraint in these regions reflects
selection on overlapping functional elements including splicing
regulatory elements, dual-coding genes, RNA secondary structures,
microRNA target sites, and developmental enhancers. We also ruled out
certain alternative explanations such as codon usage bias and neutral
rate variation.

Our initial results show that overlapping functional elements are
common in mammalian genes, despite the vast genomic landscape.
Furthermore, anticipating the future availability of additional
mammalian and vertebrate genomes, we are currently developing Bayesian
codon modeling methods to measure synonymous rates at even higher
resolutions, perhaps eventually allowing the detection of individual
regulator binding sites embedded in protein-coding ORFs.
