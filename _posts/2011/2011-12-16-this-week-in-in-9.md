<p>_Intelligent design news, commentary and discussion from the 9th of December to the 16th of December, 2011._</p>


<p>It's nearing Christmas, and here in Australia the weather is heating up, causing the ground to bake beneath our thong-covered feet - and a kind of cognitive dissonance sets in as the "White Christmas" imagery fed to us by popular culture and jolly old Christmas tunes conflicts with the harsh reality of Summer in December.Â Such is the Southern Hemisphere.</p>


<p>Of course I could, at this point, easily compare that tale with the cognitive dissonance present in the intelligent design movement as they wiggle around, both in cyberspace and in the real world, evading effective criticism and being ambiguous about many a topic. But I won't.</p>


<p>That would be a bit forced, wouldn't it?</p>


<p>No, I just wanted to let you all know about the wonderful Christmas we Australians will be having. Enjoy your Winter Wonderland, Northern Hemispherians: I'll be cooking sausages, avoiding swarms of flying insects and trying my best not to get **terribly** sunburnt.</p>


<p>Anyway, this week we have blog posts about biomimetics, the potential predictive powers of Judaism/Christianity when it comes to the origin of humanity, using my words to pump money into the ID movement, and Richard Dawkins brainwashing poor, poor children.</p>
