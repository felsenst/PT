As many of you may recall, I developed a population genetics simulation for PT called Red Lynx (available [here](http://pandasthumb.org/sims/) and [here](http://scit.us/redlynx/)).  I know that several people are using it in the classroom, and I would appreciate some feedback.  Just drop me a line (reed@scit.us) or post a comment letting me know where it is being used and in what class.  I'd also like any feedback on how students enjoy it.

Thanks ahead of time.
