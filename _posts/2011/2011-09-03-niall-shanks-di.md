Glenn Branch of NCSE tells us, unhappily, 


> Sad news from Kansas: Niall Shanks, whom many of us knew and whose [God, the Devil, and Darwin](http://www.amazon.com/God-Devil-Darwin-Critique-Intelligent/dp/0195161998) all of us should know, died in July; he was only 52.


I never met Professor Shanks, but he contributed a chapter to [Why Intelligent Design Fails](http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/____1147.html), and I found him a pleasure to work with.  I am saddened by the news.  You may see NCSE's obituary [here](http://ncse.com/news/2011/09/niall-shanks-dies-006857).
