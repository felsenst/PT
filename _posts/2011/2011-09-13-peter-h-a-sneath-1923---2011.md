Word has reached me that Peter Sneath died last Friday at his home in
Leicestershire.  He was 87 years old.  For a more complete and entertaining
autobiographical
account see [page 77 of this Bulletin of Bergeys International Society for Microbial Systematics](http://www.bergeys.org/bulletin/BulletinofBISMIS%201-1.pdf).

Peter was a medical microbiologist, who, in the late 1950s, began to work on
numerical methods for classifying bacteria.  He developed numerical clustering
methods.  He soon came into contact with Robert Sokal, who was doing the same.
Together they wrote _Principles of Numerical Taxonomy_, a widely-noticed
textbook advocating taking a phenetic approach to classification, basing it
on measures of overall similarity rather than any inference of phylogeny.
The smartest thing Sokal and Sneath did was to not fight over who invented
numerical taxonomy, but to join together to promote it (Sneath was first
author on the 1973 revision _Numerical Taxonomy_).

Numerical taxonomy rattled the systematic establishment, then dominated by
followers of Ernst Mayr and George Gaylord Simpson's school of "evolutionary
systematics".  It encouraged and stimulated many younger people to look
into numerical approaches.  By about 1980 phenetic approaches had been pushed
aside by phylogenetic systematics, but Sneath and Sokal's work is still
regarded by mathematical clusterers as the most important founding work in
their field.  The most widely-used of Sneath's methods is the UPGMA
clustering method (independently also invented by F. J. Rohlf). _\[See comment of September 30 below for correction of this statement\]._

I always enjoyed meeting Peter and Joan Sneath.  Peter was intrigued by any 
and all uses of numerical and computer methods in science, and was even willing on occasion to violate his own precepts and come up with methods for analyzing phylogenies.

He wrote a pioneering 1975 paper (with Sackin and Ambler) on detecting 
recombination between lineages, for example.  I remember Peter telling me that 
as he traveled around he collected soil samples to study their bacteria.  He
carried no sterile vials for that -- he simply went out and bought a ream of
typing paper, as it was sterile, then used some to scoop up the sample and
fold it into an envelope.  It was a brilliant common-sense improvisation 
typical of the best of his generation of English scientists.
