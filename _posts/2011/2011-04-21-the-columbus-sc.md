If there's anyone living in the Columbus, OH, area who's interested in getting involved (or more involved) in science outreach and the Science Cafe movement, now's your chance.   The Columbus Science Pub, which I started off back in September 2010 and which now boasts over 450 fans on Facebook, is looking for new leadership to take over when Dan (the current organizer) leaves Cowtown at the end of the summer.     

Anyone interested should send a note to columbussciencepub@gmail.com.

For more information on the Columbus Science Pub, go to [Columbus Science Pub's Facebook site](http://www.facebook.com/ColumbusSciencePub) or for information on the Science Cafe movement, check out [http://www.sciencecafes.org/](http://www.sciencecafes.org/).
