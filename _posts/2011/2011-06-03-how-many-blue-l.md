Uncommon Descent, for some reason, [just posted a link](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/rare-mutation-produces-blue-lobster/) to [an article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/atlantic/blue-lobster-one-in-a-million-find-for-fisherman/article2045453/) about a blue lobster. This isn't the first time that a blue lobster has been found, and there are even rarer [yellow](http://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2009-06-11-rare-yellow-lobster_N.htm) and [albino](http://www.thebostonchannel.com/r/24428786/detail.html) variants that are known. Since there is, as the UD article points out, [a trade in blue crayfish](http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=1075+1641&amp;pcatid=1641), it's reasonable to assume that the blue coloration in lobsters is a heritable. All that leaves me wondering something: exactly why did the folks at Uncommon Descent decide to highlight this example? 

The UD article contains the following gem:


> Apparently, there is a trade in blue crayfish for aquariums, but any similar trade on blue lobsters depends on finding another one, of the opposite sex.

Does it really? 

I didn't take a lot of time to research the genetic mechanisms underpinning lobster coloration (frankly, it's not a topic that fascinates me). I did find, however, that there's reason to suspect that the blue coloration is the result of a recessive trait ([a paper I found](http://www.springerlink.com/content/4c8ftv62tjj84hc6/) noted that a prior study had found that blue offspring only occur when two blue lobsters mate). If that's the case, does a would-be purveyor of blue lobsters really need two blue lobsters to get the business off the ground?
