Yesterday, we migrated PT to its new server: Proteus.  Proteus is a beast of a machine: FreeBSD 8.2, AMD Phenom II X6 1090T processor, 16GB of memory, and 5 2TB drives in a ZFS raidz2 array.  Most of the hardware was provided by the [Talk Origins Archive Foundation](http://www.talkorigins.org/foundation/donate.html).  If you want to support PT, you can donate to [TOAF](http://www.talkorigins.org/foundation/donate.html).

The server migration is the first step in a series of improvements that will hopefully make PT better.  The second step has also been completed: requiring registration to comment.  Hopefully, registration will go smoothly, but if you are having problems email us at thecrew@pandasthumb.org.

You many need to clear your cache if you are having problems commenting.
