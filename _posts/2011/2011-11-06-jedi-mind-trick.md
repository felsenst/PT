I'd like to thank Douglas and everyone for their kind words about my "cloning experiment" and impending appointment to Arizona State in Tempe.

I will be part of the [Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics](http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/research/research-centers/evolutionary-medicine-and-informatics) in the Biodesign Institute and the [Evolutionary Biology Program](http://sols.asu.edu/grad/evo_biodiv.php) in the School of Life Sciences.  I was hired as part of a genomics cluster, which is currently still hiring (Initial deadline is this Friday.  See the ad below.)  You could have the office next to me and Prof. Steve Steve.

I am looking to take students and graduate recruitment is underway.  I'm looking for students with a background in biology, computation, mathematics, and/or statistics and interested in studying evolution theory and bioinformatics.  I work on a variety of topics in computational evolutionary genetics, with most of my research dealing with mutations and developing analysis methods for detecting it from genomic data and high-throughput sequencing.  I also have research programs in frequency-dependent selection and scientific computing with Javascript.  If you are interested, you can check out my [full CV](http://scit.us/cv.pdf), but I've appended a list of recent papers to this post.  I can send anyone reprints if desired.

I'm also looking for undergraduate students to join my lab next semester as well.  So if you are a current or future ASU undergrad and want to work along side [Prof. Steve Steve](http://prof.stevesteve.org/), send me an email at cartwright@asu.edu.

The application deadline for the graduate program is December 15th, and the process is described [here](http://sols.asu.edu/grad/evo_bio_apply.php).

Rice University is also looking for a postdoc to fill my vacated Huxley Fellowship.  See the ad below the fold.

# ASU Graduate Program

> Graduate Program in Evolutionary Biology
> 
> The Evolutionary Biology PhD program at Arizona State University is
> recruiting students for entry in the Fall 2012 semester. This new program is
> interdisciplinary by design and enables faculty and students using diverse
> models and technologies to engage in novel and innovative research to answer
> questions related to a number of disciplines including ecology, behavior,
> physiology, population genetics, bioinformatics, and anthropology.
> 
> General information about the program as well as the application process and
> materials can be found at: http://sols.asu.edu/grad/evo_bio.php
> 
> Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to contact listed faculty to
> inquire about potential openings, fellowships, and general questions about
> research projects.
> 
> Program questions can be directed towards either of the Evolutionary Biology
> program chairs:
