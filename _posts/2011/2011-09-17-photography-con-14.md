Sorry, I have been preoccupied lately.  The winners of the photography contest are

Sky:  Turkey vultures by **James Rice**

Sea:  Fishing spider by **Michael Siccha**

Land:  Cooling pahoehoe lava, by **Andrew Cooper**

In addition, I would like to award fourth place to Ammonite fossils by **Amanda Brooks**, because she has a good eye for fossils and composition, not to mention that she is 17 years old and a senior in high school.

If the winners, including Ms. Brooks, will send me their snail-mail addresses, I will send their copies of  [The Way of the Panda](http://www.amazon.com/Way-Panda-Henry-Nicholls/dp/1846683688), by Henry Nicholls.  Once again, we thank the publisher, Pegasus Books, for their generosity in providing the books.
