Thanks to John Pieret, [the full text of Clarence Darrow's (1926) essay "The Eugenics Cult" is now online in text format](http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2011/09/reprint.html).  Clever readers could find it in Darrow anthologies at Google Books, but it's nice to have it in plain text for the purposes of searching and general Google-tasticness.  Hopefully the IDists/creationists will never be able to mention Darrow and eugenics in the same sentence again, without being sent a link to this essay.

You should go and read the essay.  It is one of the most spectacular examples of polemic used-appropriately-and-for-good that you will read.  And I find it fascinating that Darrow was leading a charge against eugenics (in his 1925 and 1926 essays) at exactly the same time that the Scopes Trial and appeals were going on (1925-1927).  It's rather more than William Jennings Bryan ever said against eugenics, I believe. (Did Bryan ever bash eugenics like this? My sense of it was that it wasn't a major point of his, despite later revisionist history from creationists.)

And, I think the essay still speaks to issues we face in the 21st century.  Although eugenics is almost universally despised today, many of the naive assumptions that made it seem like a good idea are still common today, amongst both liberals and conservatives.  E.g., both some liberals and some conservatives think that the relative breeding of human cultural groups (religious/nonreligious, rich/poor, liberal/conservative) has great significance for the future -- whereas the observed historical reality, and probably the future, is that massive cultural change is a continuous, people change cultural and religious affiliations constantly, and no safe extrapolation can be made based on uniformitarian assumptions about breeding.
