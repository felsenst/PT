**by Joe Felsenstein,<br />[http&#58;//evolution.gs.washington.edu/felsenstein.html](http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/felsenstein.html)**

There's a remarkable statement over at Uncommon Descent right now. Gil Dodgen is, as always, drawing [dramatic conclusions](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-some-point-the-obvious-becomes-transparently-obvious-or-recognizing-the-forrest-with-alls-its-barbs-through-the-trees/) that Darwinism has collapsed and that scientists refuse to recognize it (he's very good at drawing that conclusion - evidence is another matter).

Anyway, he opens with a statement that, for once, evolutionary biologists can agree with:

> At UD we have many brilliant ID apologists, and they continue to mount what I perceive as increasingly indefensible assaults on the creative powers of the Darwinian mechanism of random errors filtered by natural selection.

I really can't think of anything to add to that.
