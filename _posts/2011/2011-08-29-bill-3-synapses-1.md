If you decided not to enjoy the Ramachandran lecture when you saw that it was in a format that reminded you of Windows 3.1, I have good news. [The post has been updated](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/08/bill-3-synapses.html) with links to the new Reith Lectures site at the BBC, and now you can listen to the lecture in your browser or download it as a podcast.

It's great stuff, so don't miss it. Oh, and send me nominations for future BILLs. The email address is BILL at pandasthumb dot org.

Party on!
