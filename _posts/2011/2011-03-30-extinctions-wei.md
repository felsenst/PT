When a paper gets press, the authors get some weird reactions.  With the [extinctions paper](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/03/extinctions-pap.html), one guy emailed us to say that he agreed that species extinctions were a big problem, and that humans were the cause.  However, he said, we had the details of the cause was wrong.  The real cause was [contrails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail_conspiracy_theory).

That, though, was [not nearly as weird as this](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/congrats-nick-matzke-for-publishing-id-sympathetic-paper-in-nature/): "[Congrats Nick Matzke for Publishing ID Sympathetic Paper in Nature!](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/congrats-nick-matzke-for-publishing-id-sympathetic-paper-in-nature/)" by Sal Cordova.

Can anyone explain the psychology here?  I'm normally pretty good at psyching out creationists, but this one leaves me mystified.
