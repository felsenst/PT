The [Reverend Thomas Bayes](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/56807/Thomas-Bayes) died 250 years ago this month, in 1761.  His famous "Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances", from which stems "Bayes' Rule",  was published posthumously 247 years ago in 1764 by the Royal Society.  A detailed review of the argument in modern notation is Edwards (1978) in the _Scandanavian Journal of Statistics_.  Any of us scientists working today would be beyond lucky to have our work cited 250 later!

The [R Revolutions blog](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/04/250-years-of-bayes-theorem.html) highlights the anniversary and is posting videos explaining the significance of Bayesian thinking. Check it out!
