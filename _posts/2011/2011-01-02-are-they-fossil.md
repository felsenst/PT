In [Ediacaran roots extend deeper in time?](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/12/ediacaran-roots.html) Joe Meert described enigmatic fossil impressions that could be interpreted as Ediacaran metazoa (multi-celled animals) from strata some 100 million years older than previously known.  Now Chris Nedin, a palaeontologist who has worked with Ediacaran and early Cambrian material, has a comprehensive post on his blog [Ediacaran](http://ediacaran.blogspot.com/) titled "[770Ma Ediacara (?) Fossils from Kazakhstan (sadly no)](http://ediacaran.blogspot.com/2011/01/770ma-ediacara-fossils-from-kazakhstan.html)":

> Two questions to be asked then. Are these deposits c. 770 million years old? Are these specimens examples of Ediacaran fossils?
> 
> I think the answer to the first question is yes, and the answer to the second question is no. I'll explain below.
