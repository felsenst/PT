<big>[_Crotalus adamanteus_](http://www.uga.edu/srelherp/snakes/croada.htm) -- eastern diamondback rattlesnake, preserved in the Vertebrate Natural History collection at University of North Carolina at Wilmington.</big> Mr. Shackleton writes, Sadly, the interesting and differentiating colors of preserved specimens rarely lasts long in the alcohol. A lot of undergraduate pain and suffering would be relieved if someone came up with a preservative that didn't suck all the life out of the specimens (the alcohol bleeds all the color out of the specimens, and makes it a real pain to identify them).
