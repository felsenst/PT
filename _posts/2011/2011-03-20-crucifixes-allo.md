According to an [article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/mar/18/european-court-human-rights-crucifixes-allowed) in the _Guardian_, the European Court of Human Rights has reversed its own earlier decision and now says that it is lawful to display a crucifix in a state schoolroom. The earlier decision caused "uproar," so the full court reconsidered its earlier decision and concluded that the crucifix was "an essentially passive symbol." As the philosopher [Sidney Morgenbesser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Morgenbesser) might have said, Yeah, yeah, and a Christmas tree is just a [secular symbol](http://www.adl.org/religion_ps_2004/teaching.asp).

France, meanwhile, has [ banned religious symbols](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3531151.stm) worn by students in state schools.  So here is a philosophy question: Can you both permit and prohibit religious symbols at the same time?
