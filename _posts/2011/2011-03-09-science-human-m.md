Most mammals (the males, anyway) have a baculum, or penis bone. Human males, however, do not. Inasmuch as [men and women have the same number of ribs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve), some people have suggested that the human baculum had to be sacrificed in order to make Eve (see [here](http://vridar.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/which-bone-was-eve-made-from/) for a survey). For my part, I think it is just as well to have an upright posture and no baculum.

Now comes [a report in _Science_](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/03/how-humans-got-spineless-penises.html) to the effect that the penises of most male mammals are covered with spines of keratin, the substance of which horns are composed. Owing to a gene deletion, however, male humans lack these spines and therefore are not horny.

Additionally, we see that the human penis not only has no backbone, but also no spine.
