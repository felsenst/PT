If any of our readers or contributors are taking part in Darwin Week activities, I'd like to invite them to announce those activities here. The International Darwin Day Foundation lists the better part of 100 activities [here](http://darwinday.org/events/), most but not all between February 9 and 12. But if anyone has any pet activities to publicize, please go at it in the comments.

I will start: One of my colleagues tells me that the Iowa City [event](http://iowacitydarwinday.org/default.aspx) on February 11 and 12 will feature two talks by Frans de Waal, one technical, and one general. The general talk is entitled "Morality before Religion: Empathy, Reciprocity and Fairness in our Fellow Primates."  You may find the entire schedule and location at the link directly above.

The Secular Students and Skeptics Society at the University of Colorado is sponsoring a [weeklong event](http://ssassatcu.blogspot.com/p/darwin-week.html), February 7-11. On Wednesday, February 9, I will discuss my contention that our sense of morality is an evolved trait; by a not entirely surprising coincidence, de Waal's work figures into my talk. The no doubt sassy students will also show the movie "Creation" on Monday, February 7, followed by a discussion led by philosophy professor Carol Cleland. Again, you may find the entire schedule and locations at the link.

All I have so far. I invite anyone else who wants to publicize a specific event to do so in the comments.

**Update, January 26**: Please see below the fold for an **update**by Michael Zimmerman of the Huffington Post.

You will have to get through certain amount of boilerplate, but Michael Zimmerman has an article on the Huffington Post [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-zimmerman/betty-white-and-science-e_b_812762.html), in which he suggests writing to various media outlets and asking them to cover Evolution Sunday. Here is his list:
