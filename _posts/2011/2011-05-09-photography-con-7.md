I think this is sort of like an open letter to our readers: 

We are thinking of running a third photography contest in the summer. The theme of the first contest, which was frankly decided in arrears, was animal, mineral, and vegetable. The theme of the second contest was threatened, endangered, and invasive. 

Would anyone like to suggest a theme for a third contest?
