Quote mining is ubiquitous amongst the creationists, to the point that TalkOrigins maintains [an extensive database](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/contents.html) of mined quotes.  Now there's a new candidate.  [Gary Hurd calls our attention](http://stonesnbones.blogspot.com/2011/12/rabbi-averick-and-origin-of-life.html) to Rabbi Moshe Averick, who [quotemines Jack Szostak](http://www.algemeiner.com/2011/12/14/severe-weather-alert-dr-jerry-coyne-militant-atheistic-biologist-is-blowing-very-hot-air-in-chicago/), a prominent origin of life researcher (added in edit: and 2009 Nobel winner!).

What's most fun is that Szostak's wife, Terri-Lynn McCormick, shows up in the comments and [calls Averick on his dishonesty](http://www.algemeiner.com/2011/12/14/severe-weather-alert-dr-jerry-coyne-militant-atheistic-biologist-is-blowing-very-hot-air-in-chicago/#comment-205583).  I'll reproduce her whole comment here.  It's delicious!

> How dare you misrepresent my husband. Your quote from the Scientific American article blatantly distorts his meaning. It is virtually impossible to imagine the cell we know now to emerging from the pre-biotic earth. He and others have, over many years, been showing incrementally how an RNA cell might have been created on early earth. There is nothing in my husband's work that suggests otherwise. It is quite sickening that you would try to make him, a steadfast rationalist and atheist, into a propopent for I.D. You are in complete disagreement with Prof. Jack Szostak. Unfortunately for you his opinion is backed up by facts and mountains of results from peer reviewed research.

Nice!
