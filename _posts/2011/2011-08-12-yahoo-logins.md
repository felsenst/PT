For those of you using Yahoo logins to comment, you can customize your displayed username by going to Yahoo.com &gt; Account Information &gt; Manage/Create OpenID &gt; Show customization options.  By doing this, you can get rid of those ugly urls in your username.

**Update**

If you have already signed in with a Yahoo account, you need to remove the PT entry under "Manage App and Website Connections" from your Yahoo account settings.  Then when you sign it again, Yahoo will ask you to pick which OpenID identifier you want to use.
