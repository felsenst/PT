[LEO Weekly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Eccentric_Observer), an alternative weekly published in Louisville, Kentucky, reports that fundraising for the Ark Park has gone virtually nowhere since last May. Groundbreaking, if it was ever planned at all, has been postponed and postponed and postponed until next spring at the earliest.

LEO Weekly reports that the Ark Park has raised only about $1 million since last May and has raised a total of $4 million altogether. Its goal is to raise approximately $25 million. A representative of the Ark Park says, "Funding is progressing, a little slower \[sic\] due to the very slow economy." He says further that they are 3-4 months behind schedule and adds, "We are considering a few options to help speed up the construction and possibly open to guests earlier than our original schedule. Once we have more information developed I'll update you -- probably by the first of the year."  LEO Weekly estimates that at the present rate groundbreaking might be scheduled for 2024.

My own estimate is that their timescale is skewed by their belief that the Earth is around 5000 years old. It is in fact more like 5 billion years old. Thus, if we take 3-4 months and multiply it by the ratio of 5 billion years to 5000 years, we estimate that the groundbreaking ceremony will take place in 3 million months, or 250,000 years.

Anyone who wonders where the money may be going in the meantime might consider the [review](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.reviews&amp;orgid=5214) by a volunteer named Roxy, posted at Charity Navigator. Additionally, comments to the LEO article claim that the Ark Park itself is a for-profit venture, but the [Ark Encounter](http://arkencounter.com/) Website is not completely clear (to me, at least), and I cannot independently verify the claims. I cannot, however, find Ark Encounter in IRS [Publication 78 ](http://www.irs.gov/app/pub-78/).

Appendix. Here is what they say. On the home page,


> Your tax-deductible sponsorship donation will be assigned a unique serial number that you can use to look up the location of your peg, plank, or beam in the Ark.


But then, in the FAQ's,

> Is this a non-profit endeavor?
> 
> In a sense, the Ark Encounter is both a for-profit and not-for-profit endeavor. The Ark Encounter is a for-profit operation but is managed by a non-profit subsidiary ministry of Answers in Genesis. The LLC and its members will be responsible for all of the normal taxes required for pass-through business entities.
