BILL the second is "[Endless Forms Most Beautiful](http://youtu.be/Ncgm9QOzQsA)," by Sean Carroll. (Not the [cosmologist](http://preposterousuniverse.com/) or the biologist [formerly in Joe Thornton's lab](http://pages.uoregon.edu/joet/people/people2.html) and [currently at Harvard](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/marx/marxlabFrameset.htm), but the [evo-devo thinker](http://www.molbio.wisc.edu/carroll/index.html) who is [Vice President for Science Education at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute](http://www.hhmi.org/about/carroll.html) \[HHMI\].) Carroll's talk is the first in a [four-part series on evolution](http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/evolution/lectures.html), the 2005 Holiday Lectures sponsored by HHMI. The [Holiday Lectures](http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/hl/) are probably an exaptation of [The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures](http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?id=00000001882&amp;action=displayContent) that gave us our [inaugural BILL](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/07/bill-1-the-ultr.html).

Here are some things to look for and think about:



* An extensive historical account of Darwin's thought, including some questions about the reactions of his family.
* An emphasis on the fossil record.
* A very interesting choice of an experimental study to illustrate natural selection: [coat color in pocket mice](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/9/5268.full). Why interesting? It's the work of [Hopi Hoekstra](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/), coauthor of a [harsh critique of evo-devo](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/PDFs/HoekstraCoyne2007.pdf) that started a [quaint little scientific dustup](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hoekstra/Commentaries/2008_Science_adapt.pdf). (The article and dustup were a couple years after the lecture. More at [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/coyne_and_wray_at_the_oregon_s.php).)
* Some simple math to show the reasonableness of evolutionary change over actual time scales.
* Good questions from the audience, about how the mutations got there in the first place and whether the changes are a "coincidence."


The lecture begins and ends with comments by Tom Cech. If you just want Carroll's talk, start at about 4:00, and skip to 6:50 if you don't want the intro video on Carroll's background. And there's a transcript [here](http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/dvd/transcripts/Evolution%20Lecture%201%20Transcript.pdf).
