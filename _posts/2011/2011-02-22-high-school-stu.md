A high-school student's activity spearheading a [grass-roots movement](http://www.repealcreationism.com/) to repeal Louisiana's inaptly named Louisiana Science Education Act is "a profile in (evolutionary) courage," according to [Michael Zimmerman](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-zimmerman/profiles-in-evolutionary-_b_825770.html), writing in the _Huffington Post_. 

According to Professor Zimmerman, the student, Zack Kopplin, has already succeeded in influencing the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to adopt a new biology textbook, in the face of opposition from the powerful Louisiana Family Forum. More recently, State Senator Karen Carter Peterson announced her intention to introduce legislation repealing the LSEA, which promotes the use of "supplemental materials" in the classroom. Supplemental materials is a code term for literature that promotes creationism and attacks evolution.

Wesley Elsberry reported briefly on Mr. Kopplin's campaign [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/02/louisiana-repea.html). Please do not rehash that discussion on this thread.

Instead, please help make sure that Professor Zimmerman's article gets the widest possible readership.
