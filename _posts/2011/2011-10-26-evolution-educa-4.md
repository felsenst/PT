I hope this is not too far off task, but I wanted to brag that my colleague Paul Strode is one of two high-school science teachers who will take part in the national [Education across the Life Sciences](http://nas-sites.org/thinkingevolutionarily/) meeting in Washington.  According to an [article](http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_19172793) in the Boulder _Daily Camera_, he will serve on a panel on "Thinking Evolutionarily: Evolution Education across the Life Sciences." The purpose of the meeting, which is sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences,  is to

> enable educational leaders, members of professional scientific societies, and members of other scientific and science education organizations to develop a strategic plan that will develop a national database of resources from disciplines across the life sciences to help faculty make evolutionary science a central focus of introductory biology survey courses and other courses across the life sciences curriculum.

Incidentally, I am the unnamed Colorado School of Mines (not University of Colorado) professor who co-authored the book [Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)](http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/Why_Evolution_Works.html) with Dr. Strode.  I hope no one will consider it churlish of me to note that I am somewhat bemused by the fact that, when the book came out, I could not get the _Camera_ to review it.
