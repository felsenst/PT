[Georgia Purdom](http://www.answersingenesis.org/outreach/speakers/georgia-purdom/bio/) is a functionary--a "scientist"--at Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis.  She has a Ph.D. in molecular genetics from the Ohio State University and was for a time on the faculty at Mt. Vernon Nazarene University in Ohio.  (Interestingly, she left MVNU after 6 years, about the time when tenure decisions are made in most institutions. I know nothing specific, but it's always fun to speculate.)  In [a recent blog post](http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/georgia-purdom/2011/01/18/scientists-and-science-should-not-be-questioned/) commenting on the Freshwater affair she wrote this:

> I teach Sunday school for first through third grade, and over the next few weeks we'll be discussing dinosaurs, radiometric dating methods, natural selection, and mutations. I teach them that what they learn in public school in regard to historical science concerning these ideas is not the truth. 

That's child abuse of a very high order, worse even than Freshwater's because the children are so much younger.  Those kids are screwed.
