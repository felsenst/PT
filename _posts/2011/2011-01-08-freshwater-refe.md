[Knoxpages.com is reporting](http://knoxpages.com/?NewsID=8263&amp;CatID=1) this morning that R. Lee Shepherd, the referee in the administrative hearing on the termination of John Freshwater as a middle school science teacher in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, has recommended that Freshwater be terminated.  I don't have the referee's report yet, and will post more when I do.  Meanwhile see Adam Taylor's story at the linked site.
