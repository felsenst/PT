The series is sponsored by public TV station [WOSU](http://www.wosu.org/), by the [Center for Science and Industry](http://www.cosi.org/) in Columbus, and by the Department of Entomology at the Ohio State University.  [I wrote about one such](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/11/noma-is-alive-a.html) on the Thumb four years ago.  They have had a distinctly "accommodationist" flavor, and given the Templeton Foundation's funding of the series (via Susan Fisher of the Department of Entomology at Ohio State), I suspect this one will carry on that theme.  I know little of Tiger's or Wade's views on that, so I may be wrong.  The entire series of webcasts is archived at [this site](http://library.osu.edu/about/partners/osu-department-of-entomology/the-intersection-of-science-and-faith).

Tom Baillieul, a member of Ohio Citizens for Science, has a background essay on the evolution of religion [available here](http://earthfriendarts.tripod.com/evolve/religion.pdf) (PDF).

(I can't resist noting that the Department of Entomology is also home to one of the creationist "scientists," Glen Needham, who played a significant role in the [Bryan Leonard affair](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/06/id-vs-academic.html) at Ohio State.)
