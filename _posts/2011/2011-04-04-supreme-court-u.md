The headline says it all.  See [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/us/05scotus.html) for the latest article by Adam Liptak in the _Times_.  To put it as briefly as possible, the Court seems to think that a tax expenditure is not an expenditure.  My earlier posting on the topic is [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/11/tax-credits-for.html). 

Thanks to Jim Lippard for lighting a fire under me.
