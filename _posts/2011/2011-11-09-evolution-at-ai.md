Gaythia Weis has just sent me the following announcement:


> **Associated Students of Aims Community College invite the public to a free program to discuss evolution**
> 
> The public is invited to attend a discussion on the theory of evolution, led by Richard Bond, Ph.D. ["Science, Theories, Stories: The Real Issue,"](http://www.aims.edu/about/pio/news.php?id=325) will be presented on Nov. 14 from noon to 1:30 p.m. in Ed Beaty Hall Theater on the Aims Community College Greeley campus. Bond is a former president of Morgan Community College and the University of Northern Colorado, where he holds President Emeritus status as well as Professor Emeritus of Zoology. He has also served three terms in the Colorado Legislature in addition to eight years on the Aims Board of Trustees. He also occasionally teaches adult education at First Congregational United Church of Christ.

The program is sponsored by the Associated Students of Aims Community College, and the announcement is followed by this disclaimer:

> The views presented at this program do not necessarily represent those of Aims Community College or the Associated Students of Aims Community College.

A pity that the college has to state publicly that they do not necessarily support genuine science, but at least they are on the right track.
