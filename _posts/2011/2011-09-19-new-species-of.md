According to the Beeb, there is a [new species of sparrow](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14947902), the Italian sparrow.  Not the first instance of speciation within human memory, but a nice example. The species was originally a cross between the two other species, and the article notes that speciation by this mechanism may be more common than had been thought.
