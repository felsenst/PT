As [predicted](http://scienceantiscience.blogspot.com/2010/11/florida-academic-freedom-coming-soon.html) by Joe Meert, Florida's legislature is [once again](http://ncse.com/news/2011/03/antievolution-legislation-florida-006524) considering [antievolution legislation](http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1854/BillText/Filed/HTML). This particular attempt is done as a change to a law rather than as a standalone effort.

And the strategy in this one is to label it "critical analysis", like Ohio did in 2002.

See the [Florida Citizens for Science blog](http://www.flascience.org/wp/) for further coverage and advice on activism.
