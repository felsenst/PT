Mother Jones has the news in [this article from June 9th](http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/06/gops-favorite-historian-founding-fathers-opposed-evolution):

> On Wednesday, Right Wing Watch flagged a recent interview \[David\] Barton gave with an evangelcial talk show, in which he argues that the Founding Fathers had explicitly rejected Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Yes, that Darwin. The one whose seminal work, On the Origin of Species, wasn't even published until 1859. Barton declared, "As far as the Founding Fathers were concerned, they'd already had the entire debate over creation and evolution, and you get Thomas Paine, who is the least religious Founding Father, saying you've got to teach Creation science in the classroom. Scientific method demands that!" Paine died in 1809, the same year Darwin was born.
