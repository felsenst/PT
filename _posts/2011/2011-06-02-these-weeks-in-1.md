<p>_Intelligent design news and discussion from the 19th of May to the 2nd of June, 2011_.</p>


<p>Exams, exams and more exams are what're coming up in my life soon, so understandably I've been a little sidetracked from blogging. But no fear! TWiID is back after a week off (I'm lucky the acronym still fits after I use the alternate multi-week title, I suppose), and I'm ready to get stuck into some ID news and discussion. The big story over the past week has been the Louisiana Science Education Act (LSEA), the repeal of which recently (and unfortunately) failed, much to the delight of the Discovery Institute and friends, who have been lobbying to preserve the "academic freedom" act ever since it was challenged by the repeal last year. I'll be spending a bit of time on the LSEA, as there have been two major blog posts by the DI on the topic recently, and I want to touch on some points that I think many anti-ID supporters of the repeal have overlooked.</p>


<p>I'll also be discussing posts on the mysterious and surprising link between mathematics and biology, and the teleology of life.</p>
