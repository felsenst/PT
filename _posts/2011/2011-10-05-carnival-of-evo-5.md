You'll find a rich diversity of entries, ranging from antibiotic-resistant ice-age bacteria to penguins in Africa. A book review, a podcast, and Flying Monsters 3D. Letters from Huxley. The cost of lanterns (fireflies are the topic). "Magic traits." Jawless fish, fish with limbs, malaria. And, of course, sex with Neanderthals.

Carnival admission is free. Rides are safe for people, but may be harmful to ideas. Now run along!
