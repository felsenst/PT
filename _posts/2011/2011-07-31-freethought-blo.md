PZ Myers, Ed Brayton, The Digital Cuttlefish, Chris Rodda, and DarkSyde are starting a blog network called [FreethoughtBlogs.com](http://freethoughtblogs.com/).  It'll open August 1, tomorrow.  From the comments on the [Facebook announcement](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=198237726899882) of the opening
it looks like Ophelia Benson will be joining it soon, too.
