A reader sent me [this link](http://www.kentucky.com/2011/08/08/1839007/noahs-ark-theme-park-to-get-75.html) with the subject line above.  The state and the county have committed $40 million in tax credits, as well as other perks, to a for-profit venture to build an Ark Park in order to spur "economic development."  Someone may correct me, but unless I am mistaken such enticements for sports stadiums and other ventures almost never pay for themselves. Besides, a state senator notes at the bottom of the article, the developer said it did not need the incentives, so why were they offered?
