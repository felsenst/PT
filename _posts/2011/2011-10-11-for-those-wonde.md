I unpublished a post I put up 17 minutes ago on the HuffPo's reporting of Freshwater's appeal.  I failed to read carefully and mistook an [AP news story](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hhbMhy7KHBFGR7_yCd6Y6tMkfuSw?docId=0fc29159def140d7a9b473f65a67c31d) reported on the Rutherford Institute's site as the press release [I linked below](http://www.rutherford.org/articles_db/press_release.asp?article_id=972).  _Mea culpa_.
