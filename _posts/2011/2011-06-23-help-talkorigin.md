As most of you already know, the production company Premise Media went bankrupt. Their execrable propaganda film, "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed", is on the auction block. The online auction is proceeding now, and will end on Tuesday, June 28th. 

The auction promises that besides all available rights and interests in the finished film itself (there is an existing distribution contract), the winner will get all the production materials and rights to them. Want to know what was in the _rest_ of the interviews with Richard Dawkins and PZ Myers? I know I would like to have that material archived and made available to the public, among other things that Premise Media found inconvenient to include in their film.

There was talk among individuals on "After the Bar Closes" about the auction. Kristine Harley pointed out that, depending on exactly what is in the production materials, there may well be "Wedge Document 2" in there somewhere. When the "academic freedom" label on religious antievolution goes to court, it could be very handy to have those materials on hand. 

But any one individual is unlikely to have the wherewithal to make the winning bid on this.

Today, the TalkOrigins Archive Foundation approved a resolution to use our funds on hand to put in a bid on "Expelled". We hope to make many of the materials freely available and to collaborate with other groups seeking to produce rebuttals to claims made in "Expelled". To that end, we would like your help. Our final bid amount will be determined by funds on hand and what has come in via [our PayPal donation button](http://tinyurl.com/6e2zvpy) by Monday, June 27th. This is because there are delays in transfers between PayPal and the bank, and (hopefully!) we'll need to pay out of our bank account.

Ken Fair, our secretary and treasurer, wrote a [detailed discussion](http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=5152;st=3300#entry189839) of donations and bidding. The short of it is that while we hope to bid and win the auction, we don't know what the bid prices will be come the 28th, and cannot guarantee that we will win the auction, especially since it has an unknown reserve price on it. We cannot refund donations, so even in the case of us making the winning bid, donations that take us beyond that amount would remain part of the TOAF funding. On the other hand, contributions to the TOAF are tax-deductible for USA residents and will be used in accordance with the TOAF's mission. 

I hope that by providing a single point at which we can pool our resources, we'll have a better chance to put in the winning bid on "Expelled". Even if we don't manage to make the winning bid, every bit that we can do to raise our bid helps in that the other side will have to take even more money out of their current projects in order to beat the bid.

**Update:**  Professor Richard Dawkins has chipped in to help the TalkOrigins Archive Foundation "Win Ben Stein's Movie". If you haven't taken a moment to visit the Foundation's donation page and chip in your own stake, remember that our bid amount tomorrow (Tuesday) will be based on what can be cleared  through the system into our bank account today (Monday).
