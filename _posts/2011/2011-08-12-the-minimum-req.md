Mark Pallen (of [Pallen and Matzke](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/flagellum-evolu.html) fame) offers an interesting take on on [the Minimum requirements for a PhD thesis](http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2011/08/minimum-requirements-for-a-phd-thesis/).

> I am getting tired of having to examine sub-standard PhD theses and then having to write the same old comments in the report on the thesis, so I have decided to set down the minimum requirements for a PhD thesis. Anyone who is contemplating asking me to examine a thesis should read these and comply with them or stop wasting my time. And be warned, you don't want to get me cross by wasting my time with substandard theses that are an insult to my intelligence!

All you grad students out there need to take note of his advice.
