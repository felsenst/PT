This lovingly prepared version includes nematodes, spider mites, mimiviruses and some information about an odd genus called _Homo_. Don't miss great entries from the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action](http://beacon-center.org/).

It's a very nice edition of an excellent carnival. Click on over.
