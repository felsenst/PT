<p>_Intelligent design news, commentary and discussion from the 2nd of December to the 8th of December, 2011._</p>


<p>It's well and truly holidays now, and after getting all the fiddly, tricky things out of the way first - such as doing [a domain transfer](http://www.jackscanlan.com/2011/12/domain-evolution-goodbye-naontiotami-com-hello-jackscanlan-com/) and [dealing with responses](http://www.jackscanlan.com/2011/12/you-win-or-you-die-unintentionally-nourishing-the-id-rhetoricotrophs/) from the Discovery Institute - it's time to get back into TWiID and see what the online presence of the intelligent design movement has been like over the past seven days.</p>


<p>What are the notable posts about this week? Why: multiverses; responding - again - to me; the identity of the Designer; and why design in nature may not be so easy to detect after all.</p>
