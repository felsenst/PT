Answers in Genesis hosted a "[date night](http://barefootandprogressive.blogspot.com/2011/01/date-night-at-creation-museum.html)" last night at their Kentucky Kreationism Komplex, where couples could attend a talk by Ken Ham, dine in the main hall, and attend a concert.  Talk about romance!  And since AiG has pledged to not discriminate in order to obtain government subsidies, we all expect them to welcome gay couples to their event, right?  [Wrong](http://barefootandprogressive.blogspot.com/2011/02/no-same-sex-couples-allowed-at-creation.html).

But Answers in Genesis didn't send them packing without a dessert; they refused to refund the tickets.  We knew they were a bunch of scholastic frauds, but now we know they are a bunch of criminal frauds as well.
