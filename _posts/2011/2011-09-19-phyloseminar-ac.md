Tomorrow at 1:00pm Texas Time (CST), Oscar Westesson will be presenting a [Phyloseminar](http://phyloseminar.org/).

> The "multiple sequence alignment" is a computational artifact. In
> nature there is no such thing; rather, an alignment represents a
> partial summary either of indel history, or of structural similarity.
> Here we show, via evolutionary simulation tests, that all
> currently-available multiple alignment tools introduce systematic
> biases into downstream evolutionary analysis - particularly when used
> to reconstruct histories of insertions and deletions.
> 
> I will present our unification of Felsenstein's "pruning"
> algorithm and "progressive alignment" to build a fast,
> linearly-scaling approximate-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
> alignment/reconstruction algorithm. Inference of evolutionary history
> in this framework displays a clear improvement in accuracy over
> non-statistical phylogenetic reconstructions and a massive improvement
> in performance over slow-running MCMC statistical reconstructions.

Phyloseminars are streamed live, and can be watched anywhere you have an Internet connection.  To learn how to connect, [visit the Phyloseminar page](http://phyloseminar.org/connect.html).
