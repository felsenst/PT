Over at Uncommon Descent an unusual discussion has erupted.  A commenter named
"MathGrrl" who has been occasionally active there as a critic of ID has
actually been allowed to make [a guest posting](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/on-the-calculation-of-csi/).  She gave several examples of 
situations where one could make a specification of what were the best 
genotypes, and asked how in these cases Complex Specified Information could be 
defined. She has handled the discussion with great restraint.  Several hundred 
comments later no consensus has emerged.  
Commenters at anti-ID blogs (

and [here](http://www.rationalskepticism.org/creationism/csi-finally-defined-t20871.html)), 
have concluded 
from this that the concept of CSI is vacuous.

I'd like to give a perspective that may be unpopular here. I don't think 
Complex Specified Information is a vacuous concept, though we usually do not 
have enough information to actually calculate numbers for it.

Simply put, birds fly and fish swim.  They do so a _lot_ better than
organisms coded by random strings of DNA (formed by mutation without natural
selection -- organisms coded for by monkeys typing with four-key typewriters).
If we could imagine looking at all possible such organisms with the same length
genome as (say) a bird, the fraction of them that would fly as well as a bird,
or better, would be incredibly tiny.  So tiny that if every particle in the
universe were a monkey with an ATGC typewriter, there would not have been
enough time by now to produce anything as good as a bird even once since the
time of the Big Bang.  That is the essence of William Dembski's argument.  Note
that getting technical about information theory is not required.  People love
to contradict each other about information theory, but we can set most of that
part of the argument aside.

A simple definition of Specified Information would be that it is the negative 
log (to the base 2) of the fraction of those sequences that are better at
flying than a bird.  We don't have enough information to actually calculate it,
but we can be sure that it is big enough to pass Dembski's threshold of 500
bits, and thus CSI is present.

So am I saying that CSI is present in examples of life?  Yes, I am.  So does 
that mean that it follows that design is present in those cases?  _No, it
does not._  As I
have explained before
([here](http://ncseweb.net/rncse/27/3-4/has-natural-selection-been-refuted-arguments-william-dembski)), Dembski draws the conclusion that the 
presence of CSI proves design because he has a theorem, the Law of 
Conservation of Complex Specified Information (LCCSI), which supposedly proves 
that an amount of specified information large enough to constitute CSI cannot 
arise by natural processes, even once in the history of the universe.  In 
fact, he is wrong, for two reasons:

\* His theorem is not proven.  Jeffrey Shallit and Wesley Elsberry pointed out
([here](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/eandsdembski.pdf)) that
Dembski violated one of the conditions of his own theorem when gave his
proof that this large an amount of SI could not arise by deterministic processes.

\* In any event, to use his theorem (even if it were proven) to rule out natural
selection you have to use the same specification (say "flies as well as or
better than this bird") both before and after evolutionary processes act.  And 
this Dembski does not do.  His conservation theorem involves changing the
specification in midstream. _When you require that the specification say the
same, you can immediately see that the amount if SI cannot be conserved._  
Natural processes such as natural selection _can_ improve the flight of 
birds.

Advocates of ID endlessly repeat the mantra that the presence of CSI proves
that design is present.  They are relying on Dembski's LCCSI, whether they know
it or not.  But natural selection _can_ put Specified Information into genomes, 
and when it acts repeatedly, can easily exceed the threshold that Dembski uses 
to define CSI.  The issue is not CSI, it is the conservation law, one that has
not been proven in any form that is relevant to detecting design.
