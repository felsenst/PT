After [watching an episode of the Jon Stewart show](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda/do-well-by-doing-good_b_858148.html), a frustrated [Chris Rodda](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda) has decided to make her book [Liars for Jesus](http://www.liarsforjesus.com/) available free as a [pdf file](http://www.liarsforjesus.com/downloads/LFJ_FINAL.pdf). Ms. Rodda is senior research director for the [Military Religious Freedom Foundation](http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/), which I recently discussed  [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/03/right-wing-fund.html).
