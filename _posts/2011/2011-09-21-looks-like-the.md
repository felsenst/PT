Looks like the cartoonist Wiley Miller has [started a series of strips on teaching the "controversy."](http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur/2011/09/19) He's got the age of the dinosaurs wrong, and carbon dating does not work that far back anyway, but, hell, the strip _is_ called Non Sequitur.  The [money quote](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/magazine/13ONLANGUAGE.html) so far is, "Um, just as an F.Y.I., saying 'facts' would be a lot less offensive if you used air-quotes."
