Scientific American has posted what you might call a [compendium](http://www.scientificamerican.com/report.cfm?id=evolution-education) of articles on evolution -- some from the archives, some brand new. 

The featured articles include a new article by [Lauri Lebo](http://laurilebo.com/dp/), who details the manner in which creationists hide their true intentions by using code words such as "helping students understand, analyze, critique and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories covered in the course being taught." Indeed, in a display that gives _chutzpah_ a bad name, they invoke the name of John Scopes, because he stood up for academic freedom.

A second article includes an interview with Jennifer Miller, one of the teachers who testified at the Dover trial; Ms. Miller observes that she is no longer afraid to cover evolution and indeed spends time debunking intelligent-design creationism. A third article, a slideshow, which I did not look at, is a timeline of "Evolution in the U.S. public education system." The fourth featured article is a 2008 article by Genie Scott and Glenn Branch of the [National Center for Science Education](http://ncse.com/), and evidently describes how "Creationists who want religious ideas taught as scientific fact in public schools continue to adapt to courtroom defeats by hiding their true aims under ever-changing guises," but it appeared that I could not get the whole article without a subscription.

Finally, Scientific American provides links to a handful of earlier articles dating back to 2000.

Thanks to Bora Zivkovic for the tip.
