Well, no, not really, but a recent program on National Public Radio in the U. S. claimed that "[Evangelicals Question the Existence of Adam and Eve](http://www.npr.org/2011/08/09/138957812/evangelicals-question-the-existence-of-adam-and-eve)." More specifically, the program noted that Dennis Venema of Trinity Western University and a few other evangelical scholars argue, correctly, that evolutionary theory precludes the possibility that all of humanity descended from a single couple. Let us hope that they are the thin edge of the wedge.

Unfortunately, the bottom line is more likely a statement by Albert Mohler, the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary: "Without Adam, the work of Christ makes no sense whatsoever in Paul's description of the Gospel ...." I have no idea whether this claim is true, but it is certainly not evidence for the existence of Adam. Venema and the others are on the right track when they note that the Bible consists of allegory and poetry, as well as history, and need not be taken literally. Mohler, by contrast, needs to learn the meaning of the phrase [begging the question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question).
