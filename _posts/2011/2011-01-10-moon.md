<big>Waxing crescent [moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), February 2, 2010, Pitt Meadows, B.C.</big>  Mr. Lord assures us, "It's the moon, it's cosmological!  The picture was captured with a Canon T1i DSLR camera at prime focus on a 10-in Meade SN-10AT telescope from my back yard.  1/800 s, ISO 400. 5 exposures of the full view of the moon were stacked together (not a mosaic) in Registax to reduce noise and distortions, producing a sharper final image."
