<p>_Intelligent design news from the 23rd of March to the 29th of March, 2011._</p>


<p>This week [marked](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2011/03/what_intelligent_design_offers045251.html) the highly notable, first ever mention of yours truly in an official Discovery Institute blog post, which is rather exciting. It's a pity then that, [as I already said today](http://www.naontiotami.com/2011/03/jack-scanlans-position-on-theism-unknown-search-not-necessary/), the mention was a horribly confused jumble ofÂ misinterpretation and laziness that made me come off like an undefinable supporter of ID-dualism, or something like that.</p>


<p>But whatever, that doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. What else happened this week in the online world of intelligent design?</p>
