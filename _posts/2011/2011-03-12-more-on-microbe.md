Over at [Science in Pen and Ink](http://leilabattison.wordpress.com/) Lelia Battison has an [in-depth discussion](http://leilabattison.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/microbes-on-a-moonbeam-disentangling-the-meteorite-microbe-claims/) of Richard Hoovers' paper on alleged "fossil" bacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites in the [Journal of Cosmology](http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html). It is an excellent article that covers a lot of issues not previously covered, and brings together some other information that has been scattered around. I'm referenced as well. Go have a read of [Microbes on a Moonbeam, disentangling the Meteorite  Microbe claims](http://leilabattison.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/microbes-on-a-moonbeam-disentangling-the-meteorite-microbe-claims/).
