My research doesn't have an easy outreach component.  There is only so much you can do to get K-12 students interested in the bioinformatics of indels.  My colleague Dan Ksepka has a much better time getting the public interested in his research.  Of course, he works on the giant fossil penguins of Peru (http://fossilpenguins.wordpress.com/).  He recently gave a talk on penguin evolution to open [NC State's seminar series for research professionals](http://media.www.technicianonline.com/features/penguin-presentation-launches-seminar-series-1.2554278).  Luckily it has been archived online.  So grab the munchkins, sit them in front of the monitor, and let them marvel the awesomeness of penguins the size of Danny Devito.
