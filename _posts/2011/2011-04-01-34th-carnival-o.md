The newest edition of the [Carnival of Evolution](http://carnivalofevolution.blogspot.com/) is up at [Quintessence of Dust](http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2011/04/34th-carnival-of-evolution.html). Support your local carnival, especially if you're curious about chemotaxis, pit vipers, kin selection, or **human penises**. Yes, it's the 1 April edition. No, that last entry is not a joke. But it should get you moving.
