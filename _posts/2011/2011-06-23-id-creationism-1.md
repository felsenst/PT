A [venerable claim of creationists](http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html#CF) is that evolution somehow or other violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  In its tradition of recycling old-line creationist claims, the intelligent design movement, in the person of [Granville Sewell](http://www.math.utep.edu/Faculty/sewell/), a professor of mathematics at the University of Texas El Paso, has taken up the creationist Second Law claim.  For the few here who don't regularly read him, I have to say that [Jason Rosenhouse's takedown](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2011/06/evolution_and_the_second_law.php) of Sewell's claims (and in particular Sewell's whining about a rejected ms.) is lovely.  Highly recommended.
