This afternoon is the last chance that you will have to donate to [TalkOrigin's effort to win Expelled at auction](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/06/help-talkorigin.html).

Professor Richard Dawkins has chipped in to help the TalkOrigins Archive Foundation "Win Ben Stein's Movie". If you haven't taken a moment to visit the Foundation's donation page and chip in your own stake, remember that our bid amount tomorrow (Tuesday) will be based on what can be cleared through the system into our bank account today (Monday).
