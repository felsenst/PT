Kelly Kohls, the nutritionist and school board member in Springboro, Ohio, who [advocated teaching creationism](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/08/another-year-an.html) in that district, has [revised her position](http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/official-vouchers-could-be-creationism-option-1223769.html).  She now says that she 

> ...wants parents of students in public schools to have options if they want their children to learn about theories like intelligent design.

and that

> ... parents should have the choice of using state funds to send their children to other schools if they want to learn about creationism and intelligent design.

A potential route, she thinks, is school vouchers, where state money is paid to parents to send their children to private, often sectarian, schools.

> Tina Gangl, who has a daughter in Springboro elementary school and a son at the nearby Catholic Bishop Fenwick High School, said public schools should not teach religion.
> 
> "We need to educate our children about science," Gangl said, "If I want to teach my religion to my kids I'll send them to a religious school. There is no place for it in public school."
