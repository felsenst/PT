<figcaption markdown="span">
<big>[Cloud iridescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_iridescence).</big> The brightest example of cloud iridescence I have ever seen -- visible without polarizer or sunglasses for around an hour. The photograph is not enhanced in any way. The sky, alas, is underexposed and appears black; enough to make a person long for Kodachrome.
