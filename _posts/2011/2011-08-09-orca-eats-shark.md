I think [this story](http://www.gadling.com/2011/03/27/killer-whale-devours-great-white-shark/)&nbsp;calls for revising the rules of [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock) into Rock-Paper-Scissors-Orca-Shark. You know, Paper covers Rock, Scissors cut Paper, Orca puts Shark into state of tonic immobility.
