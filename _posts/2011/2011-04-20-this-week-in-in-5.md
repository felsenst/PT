<p>_Intelligent design news from the 14th of April to the 20th of April, 2011._</p>


<p>Another week, another lot of ID blog posts to wade through. Not a lot I want to mention in this intro, particularly, except for perhaps [this recent post](http://www.naontiotami.com/2011/04/the-conceptual-alchemy-of-id-transmuting-baseless-assertions-into-scientific-predictions/) of mine responding to an _Uncommon Descent_ post about ID's supposed scientific predictions. It was going to be included in this post, but it needed a larger amount of specific attention, given how important the topic is. It should be cross-posted on PT in a little while, but I just wanted to give you all a heads-up.</p>


<p>Other than that, this week wasn't particularly noteworthy. Nothing that changed the ID/evolution game too much, just some ideas to consider. Robert Crowther wrote about the difference between promoting ID and teaching criticisms of evolution, Casey Luskin attacked the NCSE's Steve Newton for over/misusing the word "creationist", and Jonathan Wells' new book on junk DNA got a flattering plug, possibly foreshadowing another book-promoting frenzy...</p>
