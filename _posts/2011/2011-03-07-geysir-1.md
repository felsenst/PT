<big>[Geysir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geysir), Haukadalur Valley, Iceland, 2010.</big> Actually, Geysir (from which derives the English word geyser) is not so active these days; the pictures show the nearby Strokkur geyser, which erupts every 20 minutes or so. The eruption is preceded by a short-lived blue dome. The four pictures shown here are not all the same eruption. The blue dome in particular was somewhat hard to photograph.
