<p>_Intelligent design news and discussion for August 10th to August 18th, 2011._</p>


<p>This week, the Discovery Institute did something rather strange. Well, actually, it's been leading up to it for a while, but it was only in the last week that this trend became completely apparent: _Evolution News & Views_, its main blog, is now devoting serious amounts of space in its written output to posts on religion and atheism. Often these posts have seemingly little or nothing to do with the stated purpose of the blog, which is to "\[provide\] original reporting and analysis about the debate over intelligent design and evolution, including breaking news about scientific research": Â it's had a "[Faith and Science](http://www.evolutionnews.org/faith_and_science/)" category for a while now, but the intensity of posts has reached a somewhat amusing level, most of them coming from the supernaturally-inclined mind of DI Senior Fellow David Klinghoffer.</p>


<p>So, in this edition of TWiID, I'll be touching on many of the religious posts over the last week on _ENV_, as well as more on the bacterial flagellum (again!) and the supposed design and inspired beauty of butterfly wings.</p>
