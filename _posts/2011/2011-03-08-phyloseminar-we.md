[Brian O'Meara](http://www.brianomeara.info/) (University of Tennessee, NIMBioS) speaks Wednesday, March 16th at 2pm EST on "Making comparative methods as easy as ABC."  The seminar will take place online and anyone can participate.  Instructions on how to join can be found at a http://phyloseminar.org/.

**Abstract:**

For decades, biologists have addressed evolutionary and ecological
questions using measurements of species traits, phylogenies, and an
assortment of comparative methods. Unfortunately, while there is a
large assortment of these methods, they are still fairly limited and
development of new methods is slow. It took seven years between the
introduction of using a simple Brownian motion model for looking at
trait evolution (Felsenstein, 1985) and the use of this same model for
looking at rates of trait evolution (Garland, 1992), and an additional
14 years to more powerful tests using a small modification of the
basic model (O'Meara et al., 2006). Still other promising methods are
described and even tested but remain unavailable to empiricists
because they are not put into software. As a result, the questions
empiricists can ask about the world are limited by the research
productivity of the few dozen scientists who develop and implement new
methods in phylogenetics. We describe a new approach based on
Approximate Bayesian Computation and implemented in R that will allow
researchers to easily develop their own models for trait evolution
without requiring them to have specialized mathematical or
computational knowledge.
