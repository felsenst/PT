Barnes & Noble is bringing out a [slew of Westlake books](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/Westlake?store=ebook&amp;keyword=Westlake) for the Nook late this month.  Westlake, who [died nearly three years ago](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/ot-donald-westl.html), was the creator of John Archibald Dortmunder, one of the great comic criminals in the genre, and it looks like a [bunch of the Dortmunder books](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/Dortmunder?store=ebook&amp;keyword=Dortmunder) are among those being published for the Nook.
