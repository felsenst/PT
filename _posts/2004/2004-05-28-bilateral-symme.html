Among these are the various <i>Hox</i> genes, which are expressed in an ordered pattern along the length of the organism and which define positional information along the anterior-posterior axis; and another is <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>) which is one of several conserved genes that define the dorsal-ventral axis. Together, these sets of genes establish the front-back and top-bottom axes of the animal, which in turn establishes bilaterality&mdash;this specifically laid out three-dimensional organization is a hallmark of the lineage Bilateria, to which we and 99% of all the other modern animal species belong.</p>

<p>There are some animals that don't belong to the Bilateria, though: members of the phylum Cnidaria, the jellyfish, hydra, sea anemones, and corals, which are typically radially symmetric. A few cnidarian species exhibit bilateral symmetry, though, and Finnerty <i>et al.</i> (2004) ask a simple question: have those few species secondarily reinvented a mechanism for generating bilateral symmetry (so that this would be an example of convergent evolution), or do they use homologous mechanisms, that is, the combination of <i>Hox</i> genes for A-P patterning and <i>dpp</i> for D-V patterning? The answer is that this is almost certainly an example of homology&mdash;the same genes are being used.</p>
