[Yesterday](http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/index.php?p=24) Pim noted that the Discovery Institute prevented Eugenie Scott from quoting from online material, stating that the material did "not do justice to the complexity of ID". Now - somewhat ironically - the DIs [Center for Science and Culture](http://www.discovery.org/csc/) has had a make-over and the very articles Scott was using are filed under "[Scientific Research and Scholarship](http://www.discovery.org/csc/scientificResearch/)". Hard to know what to say really. If the DI/CSCs "scientific research and scholarship" does "not do justice to the complexity of ID" where are we to go to get the truth about ID? Well, the Thumb, of course :)
