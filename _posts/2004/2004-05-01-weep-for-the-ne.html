<p>I read this article with stark disbelief. It's a pandering bit of fluff for Hovind's "Dinosaur Adventure Land"...in the freaking <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/arts/01DINO.html?ex=1398830400&en=d6d0a71f95c6901a&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">New York Times</a>. There is a <i>very</i> brief quote from Eugenie Scott, but otherwise the whole think is one happy ad for Kent Hovind and creationism, and it even glosses over his tax evasion troubles. Don't like Disneyland because they talk about dinosaurs living millions of years ago? Take the kids to Kent Hovind's backyard instead, where they can play on the swings while fundamentalists do their best to keep them ignorant and stupid!</p> 

<p>Just how low can the NY Times sink? Pretty low, as this article shows. I rant some more about it <a href="http://pharyngula.org/comments/629_0_1_0_C/">here</a>, but it's well-nigh impossible to adequately express my outrage.</p>
