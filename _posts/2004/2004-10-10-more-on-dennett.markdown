Over at <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</A> I have just posted a series of entries dealing with the recent bru ha ha over Robert Wright's interview with Daniel Dennett.

I wrote those entries before reading Timothy Sandefur's marvelous post on the same subject <A HREF=http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000548.html#more>here.</A>  I came to many of the same conclusions as Timothy.  He also made a number of points I wish I had thought of!  Hopefully he will have the same reaction to my thoughts on the subject...
