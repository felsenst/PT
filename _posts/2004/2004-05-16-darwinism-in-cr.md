Let me start this off with a quote from Charles Darwin:

> _I have been struck with the likeness of many of the half-favourable criticisms on sexual selection, with those which appeared at first on natural selection; such as, that it would explain some few details, but certainly was not applicable to the extent to which I have employed it.  My conviction of the power of sexual selection remains unshaken; but it is probable, or almost certain, that several of my conclusions will hereafter be found erroneous; this can hardly fail to be the case in the first treatment of a subject.  When naturalists have become familiar with the idea of sexual selection, it will, as I believe, be much more largely accepted; and it has already been fully and favourably received by several capable judges._

> Descent of Man, preface

And now let's look at this news story that has as its focus a "challenge" to sexual selection.

The implications, not only for science but also for society, could be profound. After all, you don't need to be versed in the Origin of Species to share Darwin's twin assumptions that, broadly, the purpose of sex is reproduction and that females select mates on the basis of genetic characteristics or traits.

Being versed in Darwin studies would mean that one would know that instead of _Origin of Species_ one should be looking at _Descent of Man_ for Darwin's full explication of his theory of sexual selection. And when one looks there, does one find that sexual selection is founded strictly upon the two "assumptions" identified above? No, one does not.
