Over at [stranger fruit](http://darwin.bc.asu.edu/blog/index.php?p=114), I provide a summary of Dembski's _Uncommon Dissent_ which expands on Jason's post of [July 13th](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000346.html) (while linking to his subsequent writings) and offers some thoughts on Michael Denton as ID supporter. Enjoy!
