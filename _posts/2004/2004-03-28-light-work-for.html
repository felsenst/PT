<li>Lots of us science nerds like the Sci-Fi, right? I've posted a <a href="http://pharyngula.org/comments/529_0_1_0_C/">review of Stephen Baxter's <i>Evolution</i></a>. Great title. Good book. It's a mixed review and I can tell it's not going to be for everyone, but I can say that at least the science in it is mostly right.</li>
