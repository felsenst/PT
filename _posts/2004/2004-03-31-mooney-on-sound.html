<p><a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/">Chris Mooney</a> is an indispensable source for the examination of the effects of political policy on science, and his <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp#685">latest piece in his series on "sound" science</a> is great reading. The issues he discusses, which are largely on environmental science in this case, are also highly relevant to the evolution creation debate. He quotes from a scathing report by George Brown that has the following sections:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.house.gov/science_democrats/archive/envrpt96.htm#Rep2-B">Peer Review is Suspect and the Unconventional Scientific Fringe is Probably Right</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.house.gov/science_democrats/archive/envrpt96.htm#Rep2-C">Sound Science is Empirical Science</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.house.gov/science_democrats/archive/envrpt96.htm#Rep2-D">The Trial Can Follow the Hanging</a></li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Boy, but that sounds familiar. The Intelligent Design movement practically has those written down as bylaws: uncritically accept whatever kooky minority supports your views, present a misleadingly simplistic view of science, and work from the desired result to the data you want, rather than drawing your conclusions from the data.</p>

<p>I've also made a few more comments on this subject at <a href="http://pharyngula.org/comments/537_0_1_0_C/">Pharyngula</a>.</p>
