<p>As a follow-up to my recent articles on early genes in fly development, I've also written a summary of why flies have some problems as a model system in evolution, titled <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/flies_spiders_fish_and_the_evolution_of_segmentation/">"Flies, spiders, fish and the evolution of segmentation"</a>. Early pattern formation in the metazoa is a delightfully complicated bramble, but there are some emerging comparative data that may resolve the differences.</p>

<p>Evo-devo is leading the way and guiding research, but I assure you, Intelligent Design creationism is nowhere to be found, except perhaps in hampering the educations of the next generation of scientists.</p>
