I was extremely disappointed to see that the <a href="http://www.saa.org/repatriation/nagpraamendment.html">Society for American Archaeology has issued a statement</a> supporting the amendment of NAGPRA which, if passed, would severely limit the ability of scientists to study ancient remains found on federal land. (More on this amendment <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000535.html">below.</a>) SAA says that they're just fine with the destruction of ancient skeletal remains, intended to appease American Indian creationists; they just oppose the way the amendment was introduced (rather quietly, and without substantial public comment). More on how you can help protect science at the <a href="http://www.friendsofpast.org/nagpra/040929News.html">Friends of America's Past.</a>

<b>Update: </b>Thanks to <i><a href="http://www.aracnet.com/~dcf/irnew/archives/002960.html">inappropriate response,</i></a> <a href="http://www.physanth.org/positions/cuhr.htm">here</a> is <a href="http://www.physanth.org/positions/kennewick.html">what</a> the American Association of Physical Anthropologists has to say.
