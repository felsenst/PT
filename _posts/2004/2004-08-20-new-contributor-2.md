Please welcome a new face at the bar of the Panda's Thumb, Dr. Alan Gishlick. Gish, as we call him with equal parts irony and affection, is a vertebrate paleontologist and is currently the Post Doctoral Scholar of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, CA. His research interests include functional transitions in evolution - particularly in the origin of avian flight, the reconstruction of soft anatomy in fossils, systematics, the teaching of the history of life, and the interface of science, art, and religion. 

In the unlikely event that he imbibes a bit too much Burgess Ale (since two pints likely represents about 20% of his total body weight) and says unsavory things, please bear in mind that the views he expresses here are his own and are not necessarily shared by the NCSE, its employees, or its supporters. If you get Gish confused with Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research, just remember that our Gish is the one who does not look like a cro magnon.
