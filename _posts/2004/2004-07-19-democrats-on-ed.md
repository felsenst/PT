I just want to let y'all know that the Democratic Party has released [their platform](http://www.democrats.org/platform) for the upcoming US elections.  It contains this support for science education:

> At a time when all good jobs increasingly depend on advanced skills, we will strengthen technical training for those who do not attend college. Finally, we must place a special emphasis on expanding achievement in math and science. These are subjects where America has always led the world and must continue to lead in the 21st century.

It looks like the GOP is going to [ride NCLB](http://www.gop.com/GOPAgenda/AgendaPage.aspx?id=3) as their education horse into the election.  You can read the full text of the Democrats' education platform on [De Rerum Natura](https://blog.rufus.ws/archives/000126.html).
