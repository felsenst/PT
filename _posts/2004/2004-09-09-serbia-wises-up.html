<p>Good news! <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3642460.stm">Serbia has retracted their retraction of evolution from their schools</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The Serbian government has reversed an order to ban Charles Darwin's theory of evolution from schools, following widespread criticism from scientists.
<br />
"I have come here to confirm Charles Darwin is still alive," said deputy education minister Milan Brdar.
<br />
His boss, Ljiljana Colic, who had announced the controversial policy, had gone "away on business", he said.</blockquote>

<p>I sincerely hope "away on business" is not a euphemism for anything harsher, but this is excellent news for the schoolkids of Serbia.</p>
