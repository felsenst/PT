<p>It's Father's Day, and what does everyone think of on this holiday? What is one thing that we know all fathers have in common, absent dads, neglectful dads, drunk dads, abusive dads, or even caring and responsible dads like the one I had? Why, it's <i>testicles</i>, of course. They all had at least one. So, in honor of the generative apparatus of our paternal predecessors, without which we would not be here, I have put together a few tributes to the testes, commendations to the cojones, a big hand for the balls. There's a little <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/anatomy_and_physiology_of_the_testicle/">anatomy and physiology</a>, a bit of <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/testicle_development/">development</a>, some <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/descent_of_the_testicle/">evolution of the scrotum</a>, and even &lt;shudder&gt; a link to some <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/testicle_recipes/">recipes</a>.</p>
