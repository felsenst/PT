Following on from PZ's post below, if you read the original report from the conference you find the following:

> Discussing the various scientific advances that have pointed more and more toward a Creator, the Cambridge-educated \[Stephen\] Meyer said "the future is very bright" for research into Intelligent Design.
> 
> He then revealed that donors have now contributed enough funds to create a laboratory for the study of biomolecular information at the Seattle-based Discovery Institute - a very significant development that could yield new breakthroughs.
> 
> "There is," concluded Meyer, "a lot of good science in the pipeline."

Just as well, because there has been bugger all in the five plus years since the Wedge was launched. Remember the key scientific research objective from the  [Wedge](http://www.public.asu.edu/~jmlynch/idt/wedge.html) document?

> One hundred scientific, academic and technical articles by our fellows

Still waiting. Search the scientific citation indices for works by Behe, Dembski, Meyer, Wells, Nelson _et al._ for primary research that explicitly supports 'design' or even tests design as a null hypothesis. Have one beer for every paper you find. Come back here. You'll be stone-cold sober.

It's worth pointing out that some of their other objective have been met - "Thirty published books on design and its cultural implications" and "Significant coverage in national media". Indeed they even have had some success in making "states begin to rectify ideological imbalance in their science curricula & include design theory". Just no science.
