Previous entries at this blog have mentioned the <A HREF=http://www.worldmag.com/world/home.asp>cover story</A> of the current issue of <I>World</I> magazine.  The premise was that by the year 2025 the long-promised triumph of ID over Darwin will have happened.  The magazine asked four leading design proponents to write "future histories" about how that triumph occurred.

On Monday I wrote a point-by-point reply to Phillip Johnson's contribution.  I have now done likewise for William Dembski.  His essay is available <A HREF=http://www.worldmag.com/world/issue/04-03-04/cover_5.asp>here</A>.  You can find my comments over at <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</A>.  Enjoy!

I have decided that I will not post a specific reply to Jeffrey Schwartz's essay.  It is the least insane of the four (very faint praise), and should be replied to by someone who knows more about cognitive science than I do.
