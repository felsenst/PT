I'm very far from being an admirer of John Derbyshire, and I'm sure that there are other things in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire200410150836.asp">this article</a> which will bother people, but conservatives tend to be so willing to accommodate the creationists that I was really pleasantly surprised that Derbyshire would say<blockquote><b>Human beings must have their consolations in this cold world, and wishful thinking is by no means only found on the political left, as Creationism and the "Intelligent Design" flapdoodle illustrate. Science ought to be trusted. Careful, peer-reviewed science--even human science!--ought to be read with respect, and with calm objectivity, and with the yearning to understand this strange universe, shot through as it is with mystery and wonder.</b></blockquote>

It's refreshing to see that not all of the <i>National Review</i> crowd are under the ID illusion.
