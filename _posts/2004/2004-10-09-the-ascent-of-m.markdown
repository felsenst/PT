I see the <a href="http://science.discovery.com/schedule/series.jsp?series=108603&gid=0&channel=SCI">Discovery Science channel</a> is showing Jacob Bronowski's 1973 miniseries <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ascent_of_Man">The Ascent of Man.</i></a> It's a classic work of science, history, and philosophy, eloquently and beautifully created, and certainly Bronowski's masterpiece, despite several small flaws. I'm a great admirer of <a href="http://www.drbronowski.com/">Bronowski</a> (about whom <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sande106/bronowskirev.htm">I wrote for <i>Liberty</i> magazine in December, 2002</a>). One astounding thing about this 13-hour miniseries is that it was almost entirely performed <i>extemporaneously</i>: the director pointed the camera at Bronowski, and he just talked. It's a magnificent achievement, and I encourage our readers to tune in!
