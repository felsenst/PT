According to <a href="http://blogdex.net/">Blogdex</a> right now, The Panda's Thumb is the 11th most referenced blog today. We were 15th yesterday.

According to <a href="http://www.blogpulse.com/04_03_25/links.html">Blogpulse</a>, we're #8. 

And according to <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pandasthumb.org&sub=Go%21">Technorati</a>, we now have 111 links from 68 blogs, which is enough to push us into "marauding marsupial" territory. I've never seen a marsupial maraud before, but it can't be a pretty sight.
