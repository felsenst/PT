<p>Jason South of <a href="http://wam.umd.edu/~south/">Borneo Chela</a> has posted <a href="http://wam.umd.edu/~south/2004_03_28_archives.html#108084275822840831">an account of an 'Intelligent Design' lecture</a> by a Dr Gunnar Dieckmann. It was basically the standard creationist jabber: microevolution, not macroevolution; quote-mining; straw men; polls; faulty definitions; and of course, the new weapon in the creationist armamentarium, Intelligent Design handwaving. </p> 

<p>I've been to a few of these kinds of little talks by creationists, which are usually held in local churches before a friendly crowd, and they are something to experience, just to see what kind of crap is getting peddled. If you've never been to one, try it sometime&mdash;they are common, and there seems to be a whole crop of these guys on the low-budget church picnic circuit. If you don't think you could stomach it, read Jason's article to find out what they are like.</p>
