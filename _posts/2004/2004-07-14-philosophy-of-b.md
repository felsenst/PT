A [new blog](http://philbio.typepad.com/philosophy_of_biology/) "dedicated to the history and philosophy of biology, including Darwinism, evolutionary ethics and game theory" has been started by the philosophy department at Florida State University, Michael Ruse's home department.

It's early days yet, with a couple of posts about rational behavior and economic evolution. Keep an eye out - they are seeking contributors, and yours truly has offered.
