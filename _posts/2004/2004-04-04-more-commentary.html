<p>I just noticed (via <a href="http://www.steelypips.org/principles/2004_03_28_principlearchive.php#108101410051952997">Chad Orzel</a>) that the Washington Monthly has another relevant post up&mdash;<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_04/003605.php">Kevin Drum chastises</a> the NRO's John West for his <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/west200404010900.asp">silly article about the NCSE pushing religion</a>, the same subject discussed <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000100.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Drum is asking good, pointed questions, and the ensuing comments are also interesting.</p>

<p>Addendum: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_04/003613.php">see also this followup by Drum.</a>
