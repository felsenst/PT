<p>"The Panda's Thumb" is many things...

<p>First, it is an example of jury-rigged evolutionary adaptation made
famous by the late <a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/" target="new">Stephen Jay Gould</a> in an essay of the same
name. Second, it is the legendary virtual bar serving the community of
the legendary virtual <a href="http://www.ediacara.org/" target="new">University of Ediacara</a> somewhere in the
Ediacaran hills of southern Australia, growing out of the lore of the
Usenet <a href="news:talk.origins">talk.origins</a> newsgroup. And now it is a weblog giving another voice for the defenders of the integrity of science, the patrons of "The Panda's Thumb". <p>Much as in any tavern serving a university community, you can expect
to hear a variety of levels of discussion, ranging from the picayune
to the pedantic. The authors are people associated with the virtual
<a href="http://www.ediacara.org/" target="new">University of Ediacara</a> (and thus the <a href="news:talk.origins">talk.origins</a> newsgroup), and
various web sites critical of the antievolution movement, such as the
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org" target="new">TalkOrigins Archive</a>,  <a href="http://www.talkdesign.org" target="new">TalkDesign</a>, and <a href="http://www.antievolution.org" target="new">Antievolution.org</a>.

<p>So, here's a virtual pub crawl that you might actually learn something
from. We hope you find your time spent here pleasant and rewarding.
