An interesting conference on Evolution and God:  150 years of love and war between science and religion will be held on [October 15-17, 2004](http://www.princehouse.homestead.com/EvolutionandGod2.html)

at the [Strosacker Auditorium](http://www.princehouse.homestead.com/directions.html) of the Case Western Reserve University

> Darwin's revolution was not limited to the scientific world. It reverberates to this day in theology, philosophy and politics. As a result, in America today, people hear more about evolution from evangelists preaching against it, than they do from their high school teachers. This highly charged political nexus has delivered a false impression about the history of evolutionary theory and its interactions with walks of life outside the scientific world. This conference is committed to achieving a more accurate historical understanding of these issues among historians and philosophers, and bringing that view directly to the public.
