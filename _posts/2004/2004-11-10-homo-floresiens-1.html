<p>The discovery of <a
href="http://www.nature.com/news/specials/flores/index.html">Homo
floresiensis</a>, the dwarf human species from Flores in Indonesia, has
received such massive media attention that creationists have naturally
responded to it. Carl Weiland of Answers in Genesis has written <a
href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1028dwarf.asp">an article on
<i>Homo floresiensis</i></a>, and Agape Press has also written <a
href="http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/11/52004d.asp">an article
interviewing AIG's founder</a>, Ken Ham.

<p>AIG basically agrees with the researchers who found the bones (nicknamed 'the Hobbit') that they
are a dwarf variety of <i>Homo erectus</i>. However AIG (unlike almost all
modern scientists) considers that <i>H. erectus</i> really belongs to <i>H.
sapiens</i>, and that the Flores bones should therefore be assigned to <i>H.
sapiens</i> too. The human kind, says Wieland, "had a greater range of
variation than exhibited today".

<p>That's putting it mildly. If creationists can claim that <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Homo
floresiensis</i> belong to the same "kind", on what grounds can they say
that australopithecines and <i>H. floresiensis</i> can't also be the same
kind, since in its overall body shape <i>floresiensis</i> looks more like an australopithecine
than a modern human? In fact, for a while Peter Brown and his team seriously considered placing <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa004&articleID=00082F87-7D35-117E-BD3583414B7F0000"><i>floresiensis</i> in the genus <i>Australopithecus</i></a>.

<p>I've little doubt that if <i>floresiensis</i> had been discovered in Africa, without the associated archaeological evidence, then AIG would have unhesitatingly have declared it as just another ape. They've done
that, after all, for many habiline fossils which have skulls considerably
larger than and at least as modern as those of <i>floresiensis</i>.

<p>AIG has stated <a
href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4113.asp">elsewhere</a> that

<blockquote>
<p>When complete fossils are found, they are easy to assign clearly as either
'ape' or human, there are only 'ape-men' where imagination colored by belief
in evolution is applied to fragmented bits and pieces.
</blockquote>

<p>This claim is bluster; creationists have always had <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html">a hard time
distinguishing</a> between 'apes' and 'humans'.
But <i>Homo floresiensis</i>, and AIG's attribution of it to <i>H.
sapiens</i>, really blows the claim out of the water. Now we have a 'human'
that is far smaller than, and about as primitive as, many fossils that
AIG calls apes. Where are the "kind" boundaries now? I'd love to see a
creationist line up the skulls of <i>H. floresiensis</i>,

<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/1813.html">ER 1813</a>,
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/d2700.html">D2700</a>,
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/1470.html">ER 1470</a>,
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/specimen.html#habilis">the Olduvai <i>habilis</i> fossils</a>,
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/specimen.html#oh12">OH 12</a>, and
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/3733.html">ER 3373</a>, and try to justify splitting them into two groups of
'apes' and 'humans' on anatomical grounds. As far as I know, no creationist
has <i>ever</i> addressed the human fossil record at that level of detail.
Lubenow's approach, generally adopted by AIG, was that any skull under 700cc
could be dismissed as an ape because it was too small to be a human. "The
Hobbit", with its brain size of only 380cc, leaves that strategy in tatters.
