<p>I'm trying a little experiment on the web&mdash;a project to highlight and encourage other people to write about biology or medicine or natural history by posting a biweekly digest of interesting weblog articles on those topics. The project is called <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">The Tangled Bank</a>. The <a href="http://pharyngula.org/comments/592_0_1_0_C/">first entry is currently posted</a> at my website, and the next edition will be published in two weeks and hosted at the <a href="http://invasivespecies.blogspot.com/">Invasive Species Weblog</a>. These will be places where you can learn about other weblogs that should be of interest to readers of The Panda's Thumb.</p>

<p>Our first edition has only seven entries, but we hope that will grow, and that's why I'm mentioning it here. If you even occasionally write about science on your weblog, send a URL to one of your recent articles, preferably with a brief synopsis, to <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a>. If the article meets our generous criteria, we'll acknowledge you with a link in the next edition.  Join in, make connections, spread the word about good science!</p>
