<p>There was an excellent <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/editorial/8787310.htm?1c">op-ed in the Pioneer Press</a> (free registration required; I've also posted a <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/nothing_wrong_with_discussing_evolution_in_school/">few excerpts</a>) that is well worth reading. It points out that creationists, despite legal setbacks at higher levels, have won at the schoolhouse door by intimidating teachers into avoiding the subject of evolution altogether.</p>

<p>As another issue, the author is a writer of children's books, and I believe has written this one, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/0152017720/">Our Family Tree: An Evolution Story</a>, which is intended for 4-8 year olds. That got me wondering...when was the last time anyone saw a book on evolution for young kids? The "Bible Stories for Kids" genre seems to have a lock on pediatrician's waiting rooms, I've noticed, and this looks like another niche in the PR/indoctrination front that the creationists hold.</p>
