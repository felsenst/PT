<p>This is a week for the <a href="http://tangledbank.net">Tangled Bank</a> (which will be hosted at <a href="http://www.crumpled.com/cp/personal/">Johnny Logic</a>'s place) but we've had a bit of a glitch in the e-mail. Usually, we'd have you send submissions to host@tangledbank.net; however, all mail to that address is currently bouncing...someone tried to interfere with my site, I had to increase security on my server, and somehow in the process I broke the e-mail address. Sorry. I'll try to fix it this week.</p>

<p>Until it's fixed, though, if you have John Taylor's address, you can send those submissions directly to him; if you don't, send them to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a> at <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">pzmyers@pharyngula.org</a> and I'll send them along to the right place.</p>

<p>Due to this error, we may delay this week's entry a day or two. If you've had a submission bounce, send it again to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a>. If you forgot so far, but have some cool story relevant to natural history or medicine you'd like to share, send it to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a> right away.</p>
