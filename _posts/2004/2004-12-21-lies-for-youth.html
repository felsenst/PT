<p>What really bugs me about creationists is that often they seem to be unconstrained by any respect for honesty. It's more than presenting a different side to a story; it's flagrant misrepresentation of the position of evolutionary biology, coupled to self-serving praise for their own unsupported position. There's a <a href="http://www.thetruthforyouth.com/standard/main.htm">creationist site that carries prevarication to an extreme, called "Truth for Youth"</a>, which peddles online comic books that have unbelievably dishonest distortions of the facts about abortion, homosexuality, and of course, evolution. I've <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/dont_do_it/">dissected their "Truth About Evolution" comic book</a>, but man, the others are ripe for a good flaying.</p>

<p>The "Truth for Youth" stuff exemplifies the "Lying for Jesus" strategy of too many creationists. I should think Christians would be ashamed and appalled at this dishonest propaganda skulking under the banner of their faith.</p>
