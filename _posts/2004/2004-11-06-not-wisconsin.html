<p>It looks like Wisconsin is getting ready to bolt from the ranks of the reality-based community. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/11/06/evolution.schools.ap/index.html">One of their school districts is trying to push ignorance on their students.</a></p>

<blockquote>School officials have revised the science curriculum to allow the teaching of creationism, prompting an outcry from more than 300 educators who urged that the decision be reversed.
<br /><br />
Members of Grantsburg's school board believed that a state law governing the teaching of evolution was too restrictive. The science curriculum "should not be totally inclusive of just one scientific theory," said Joni Burgin, superintendent of the district of 1,000 students in northwest Wisconsin.</blockquote>

<p>I fear we're going to see much more of this in the next few years.</p>
