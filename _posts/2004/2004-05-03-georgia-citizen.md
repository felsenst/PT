[GCISE](http://www.georgiascience.org/) has [a new color pamphlet](http://www.georgiascience.org/images/pamphlet.pdf) available that describes who we are.  If you are in Georgia or care about Georgia, print it out and share it with other concerned citizens.

GCISE has been been leading the fight to protect science education in Georgia.

GCISE was founded in response to the placement of warning stickers on Biology textbooks in Cobb County in 2002 that state:

> This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and critically considered.

We successfully fought to have the word "evolution" returned to the state curriculum and to restore important concepts from the AAAS benchmarks such as the age of the Earth, plate tectonics, the Big-Bang Theory, and the effect of humans on the environment.

GCISE is assisting classroom teachers to present evolution and the scientific method accurately and objectively.
