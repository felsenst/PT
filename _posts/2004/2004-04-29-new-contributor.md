I would like to welcome two new contributors to the Panda's Thumb crew.

**Mike Dunford** has been a contributor to talk.origins for so long that he almost doesn't feel like the new kid on the block any more. Currently, Mike is an Nth year senior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he is (finally) completing his B.S. in Zoology. Following completion of his undergraduate work, he plans to continue to study evolution in island environments (especially ones with good beaches). Current interests include speciation processes in sympatric populations, and the evolution of introduced species. In the past, he has worked as a paleontological lab technician. Other interests include the history of geology, especially in 19th century England.

**Paul R. Gross** is University Professor of Life Sciences, emeritus, at the University of Virginia. His baccalaureate and doctoral degrees are from the University of Pennsylvania. He holds honorary degrees from Brown University and the Medical College of Ohio. He is a developmental and molecular biologist who has taught at Brown, Rochester, MIT, and the University of Virginia. A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he served from 1978 to 1988 as President and Director of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, and was Vice President and Provost of the University of Virginia, where he helped to found and served as Director of the Molecular Biology Institute. He is co-author with Norman Levitt of [Higher Superstition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801857074/qid=1083256548/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-0041446-5076903?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846) (Johns Hopkins, 1994, 98) and with Barbara Forrest of [Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195157427/qid=1083256548/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/102-0041446-5076903?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846) (Oxford, 2004).

A hearty Panda's Thumb welcome to Mike and Paul. Protostome Pilsners are on the house for the next hour. Cheers!
