<p>There are certain resources out there known to those of us who keep tabs on the antievolution movement, day in, day out, that deserve a wider readership. Brian Poindexter's <a href="http://home.kc.rr.com/bnpndxtr/download/HorsesMouth-BP007.pdf" target="new"><i>The Horse's Mouth</i></a> is one of these. Brian has collected in this two-page PDF a number of quotations from leading antievolution figures where they explicitly invoke God and religious purposes as their reason for doing what they do. The PDF format means that it makes a great way to print off a number of these as needed for taking along to school board meetings, public comment periods, and the like.

<p>Here's the introductory paragraph and first example from Brian's file.

<blockquote>Intelligent Design (ID) proponents deny any
hidden creationist agendas, but rather claim
they are only trying to promote good solid science
in our public schools. To clear up any confusion
over this matter, let's hear about it straight from
the mouths of those leading the Intelligent Design
movement.

<p>"We are taking an intuition most people have [the
belief in God] and making it a scientific and
academic enterprise. We are removing the most
important cultural roadblock to accepting the role
of God as creator."

<p>- Phillip Johnson quoted, Enlisting Science to Find the
Fingerprints of a Creator, The LA Times, 3/25/2001.
