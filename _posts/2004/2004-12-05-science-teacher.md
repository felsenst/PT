In the aftermath of the decision by the Dover School Board in Pennsylvania to mandate the teaching of Intelligent Design in their science classrooms, there is quite a little fight brewing between the school board and the teachers. The York Daily Record has been following this story very closely and their [latest update](http://ydr.com/story/doverbiology/51503/) shows the internal battles. The science teachers are properly wondering what the heck they're supposed to be teaching, since there really is no model or theory of intelligent design to be referred to. Quoting the head of the science department, Bertha Spahr:


> Spahr said a problem could occur after the statement is read to the students. Once this topic is introduced, Miller said, she wonders how many questions will be asked as a result.
> 
> "I'm trained to teach to state standards," Miller said. "(â€˜Intelligent design') is currently not listed in those standards."
> 
> Miller said she hopes it will be enough to read the statement or refer students to the "Pandas" book. But she realizes that students have the right to discuss curriculum items in class.
> 
> "This is all new and something we are not prepared for," she said. "I worry that something I say could cause me to end up in some sort of litigation."
> 
> Spahr said the science teachers feel like they're in a battle that can't be won.
> 
> "The Supreme Court has said it's unconstitutional to teach creation in the classroom," she said. "So we either risk violating a school board directive or risk breaking the law. What are we to do?"
