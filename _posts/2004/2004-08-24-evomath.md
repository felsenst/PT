I'm working on a new installment of evomath.  This one is going to be some simple  examples of classical selection theory.  I am probably going to post it on [my blog](http://www.dererumnatura.us) because it is using features of a new version of Kwickcode that I haven't setup on PT.  I think I am going to wait until PT makes the switch to MT 3.1 before I install version 2 of my plugins here.

Now to encourage me to keep on track with my series, I want readers to make requests.  Is there any particular part of evolutionary theory that you would like me to cover?  Is there something you didn't quite get from your days as an undergraduate that you want to see again?  Etc.
