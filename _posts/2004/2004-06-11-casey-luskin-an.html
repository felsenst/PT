<p>I've written before about <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/casey_luskin_and_the_idea_club/">Casey Luskin and his IDEA club</a>, which exists to promote Intelligent Design on college campuses. I've criticized it for having purely religious motivations (which Luskin tries desperately to conceal), and for their very poor understanding of the science they claim to criticize. <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000246.html">Jack Krebs</a> and <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000236.html">Wesley</a> <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000244.html">Elsberry</a> here  at the Panda's Thumb have also ripped into Luskin over both of these issues.</p>

In particular, he is irate that he was caught with a current listing at a <a href="http://www.idconference.org/html/youth_conference.html">conference</a> that describes the IDEA club as a "ministry".
