<p>Oh, boy. Next week is time for the...</p>
<br />
<p><b>Society for Developmental Biology</b> 63<sup>rd</sup> Annual Meeting<br />University of Calgary, Canada<br />July 24 - 28, 2004</p>

<br />

<p>It's going to be glorious&mdash;check out the <a href="http://sdb.bio.purdue.edu/SDBNews/2004_annual_mtg/SDB_Final_Program.html">program</a>. Expect me to come back inspired and all charged up about <i>SCIENCE</i>!</p>

<ul>
<li>I'll be leaving next Thursday with my son as batman/factotum/chauffeur, so <a href="http://pharyngula.org">Pharyngula</a> might be a bit quiet for a while. Maybe. Depends on whether they have the internet up there in Canada. (OK, they <i>probably</i> do. It's going to depend more on how much time I have.)</li>

<li>Are there any Calgarians or DB geeks out there who want to get together some evening and babble or drink that potent Canadian beer? <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharygula.org">Let me know</a>.</li>

<li>I'd also be willing to temporarily loan one or a few people the keys to the Pharyngula soapbox. If you're interested in being a guest weblogger, <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharygula.org">drop me a line</a>. (Creationists, right-wingers, and evangelical fundamentalists need not apply.)</li>

</ul>

<p>I'll be taking lots of notes. Expect them to appear online sometime during or after the meeting.</p>
