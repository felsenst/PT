Guess what? The [Fossil Hominids website](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/) has just reached the ripe old age of 10 years! The site's goal is to present the evidence for human evolution, and to address creationist arguments about it. I started it in 1994 because the talk.origins archive had no material on human evolution, despite it being a hot topic in the creation/evolution debate. The first version of the site was not a web page, but a 53K text file available by ftp from the talk.origins archive, which at the time was an ftp site rather than a website. (ftp, or File Transfer Protocol, was a common way of getting files to and from other computers before the web took off). The original page was just a list of descriptions of species and fossils and a brief rebuttal of some creationist arguments. I converted it into a web page in November 95 and added the first illustrations. The page had grown to 151K by April 96, and in October 96, it was split into multiple web pages. The site has been steadily growing since 1994. At the moment, it consists of 170 web pages totalling about 1.8M in size, including a number by other contributors, along with about 230 image files. The home page gets about 400 hits per day. The site is now one of the top resources on human evolution on the web, and (I think) the best source of information about human evolution and creationism on or off the web. I've enjoyed building the site and plan to keep improving it. If you've never visited, [please drop by](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/)!
