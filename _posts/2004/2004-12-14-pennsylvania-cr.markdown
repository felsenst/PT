A while back <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000575.html">I noted</a> that, just after adopting a curriculum requiring the teaching of Intelligent Design creationism, a York, Pennsylvania school district member told the <i>York Daily Record</i> <b>"We are not going to be sued.... It's not going to be a problem. I have confidence in the district's lawyers." </b>
