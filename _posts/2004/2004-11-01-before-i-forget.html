<p>Hey, people! Did you realize this is a <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">Tangled Bank</a> week? It almost slipped my mind, so if you forgot, I can't blame you. Fortunately, it's not too late&mdash;I just sent my submission off to mrs_tilton chez yahoo co yew kay, over at the <a href="http://www.6thinternational.org/">Sixth International</a>, so it's not too late for you to do the same. Or you can send it to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">me</a>, and I'll forward it on to the appropriate party.</p>

<p>If you've written anything relevant to science, just send us a link and we'll publicize it and your web page. Everyone wins: you get more attention, we get more science on the web, readers get to learn.</p>

<p>While you're submitting those links to your science writing, also let me know if you are willing to <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">volunteer to be a host</a>! It's an even better deal to act as host for a day, since we all work to send lots of traffic your way.</p>
