I intend to review a book by Young and Edis (editors) called ["Why intelligent design fails"](http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/books/id/). 

In thirteen chapters contributors  [Gert Korthof](http://home.pi.net/~gkorthof/), [David Ussery](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/staff/dave/), [Alan Gishlick](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/7719_responses_to_jonathan_wells3_11_28_2001.asp), [Ian Musgrave](http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/Pharm/Musgrave/), [Niall Shanks](http://www.etsu.edu/philos/faculty/shanks.htm), [Istvan Karsai](http://faculty.etsu.edu/karsai/), [Gary Hurd](http://medstat.med.utah.edu/kw/osteo/hurd/apage.htm), [Jeffrey Shallit](http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/people/faculty/shallit.html), [Wesley Elsberry](http://www.rtis.com/nat/user/elsberry/), [Mark Perakh](http://www.talkreason.org/), [Victor Stenger](http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/) and of course [Taner Edis](http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/) and [Matt Young](http://www.mines.edu/~mmyoung/) show how the foundations of ID are without much scientific support. As experts in their various fields, these scientists take on various aspects of Intelligent Design claims and methodically take them apart.

This book is the lastest in a line of excellent books in which authors have addressed various aspects of the Intelligent Design movement and have shown how Intelligent Design has failed to live up to its scientific claims.

In these thirteen chapters, various authors address claims of the Intelligent Design movement., each focusing on their own specialties. Passionately but decisively they take on ID and show why it fails to live up to its claims.

In this part I will introduce the [chapters](http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/korthof68.htm), their authors and their backgrounds.
