<p>It's April Fool's Day, and our thoughts turn lightly to
some memorable April Fool's jokes of years past. The antievolution
crowd have proved good targets, primarily because of the general
willingness to accept <b>any</b> argument, no matter how lame,
if it seems to give them something against evolutionary biology.

<p>I'm going to highlight three stories from the files:                         
<p><h3><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/aprilfool.html"
target="new">The "Institute for Creation Research" and the Case of the
Tuba-Playing Neanderthal</a></h3>

<p>This tale starts with the April 1997 issue of Discover magazine,
which contained an article about work on Neanderthals by German
paleontologist Oscar Todkopf. It talked about apparent musical
instruments (the "tuba" being made from a 6' piece of mammoth
tusk) and a cave painting showing marching musicians. It continues
with the Institute for Creation Research claiming in a radio
show in 2000 that there is overwhelming evidence for Neanderthals
being musically inclined. Enjoy.

<p><h3><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/"
target="new">"Dr." Kent Hovind</a> and the <a
href="http://www.nmsr.org/onyatemn.htm" target="new">Case of "Onyate
Man"</a></h3>

<blockquote>The P. T. Barnum "One Born Every Minute" Award goes to
"Dr. Dino" himself, creationist speaker Kent Hovind, who on May 7th,
1999, in a packed room in Philadelphia, urged his audience to study
convincing new evidence of humans living with dinosaurs. Hovind's
evidence, a web site at http://www.darwindisproved.com/Archive.html,
turned out to be the annual NMSR April Fool's prank.

<p><h3><a href="http://www.ramtops.co.uk/coso.html" target="new">The
Case of the Coso Artifact</a></h3>

<p>A mysterious find from the depths of time proves our distant
ancestors had high technology! Or does it? The Coso Artifact
did baffle a number of people, including a laundry list of
creationists. Its metallic components and suggestive X-ray
analysis kept them guessing... until a collector of vintage
spark plugs stepped in and resolved the mystery. This one's
a Champion...
