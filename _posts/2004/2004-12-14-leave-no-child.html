<p>They're $2.50 each (a bargain!) Make out the check to the "UC Boulder - Bioliteracy project". And even better, look at what the money supports: <a href="http://bioliteracy.net/">The Bioliteracy Project</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Our  goal is to generate, test and distribute the tools to determine whether  students are learning what teachers think they are teaching.
<br /><br />
We assume that  accurate and timely assessment of student knowledge will pressure  the educational world toward more effective teaching.
<br /><br />
Why? Because  basic understanding of the biological sciences impacts our  lives in more and more dramatic  ways every year.
<br /><br />
A wide range of important  personal, social, economic and political decisions depend upon  an accurate understanding of basic biology and the means by which  science generates, tests and extends our knowledge.</blockquote>

<p>A good cause, a strong statement, a classy sticker for your car&hellip;how can you go wrong?</p>
