The server that hosts the Panda's Thumb was affected by the power outages in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area. The server was offline from about 4AM on the 2nd, and went back online around 7PM on the 3rd. As it is, we should consider it [fortunate to have power restored so soon](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/2608460).
