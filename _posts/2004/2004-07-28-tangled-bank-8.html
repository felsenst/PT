<p><a href="http://www.reagank.com/archives/2004_07.html#000192">Tangled Bank #8</a> is online right now. Follow the links and read about biology!</p>

<p>I am also semi-online&mdash;I just got back home after screaming across the Montana mountains and the Dakota prairies with Calgary cowboys, Canadian mounties, and a few frustrated creationists in hot pursuit. I've got a pile of great stuff from the SDB conference (including some stuff from a fun evo-devo session) to dump out of a scribbled-upon notebook onto the web, but first...sleep. Lots of sleep.</p>
