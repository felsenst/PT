The first member of LFHCfS was, naturally enough, Harvard evolutionary biologist [Stephen Pinker](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/) (who also happens to be a [Project Steve Steve](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000479.html) -- he gets around).

I move that we find out if any PT posters belong in LFHCfS.  The best nomination I could think of was Ian Musgrave.

Alright, here's Ian Musgrave:

Just kidding.  Here's the real Ian Musgrave:

If beards count, he is definitely "in."
