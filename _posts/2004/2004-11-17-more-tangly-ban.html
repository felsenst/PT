<p><a href="http://rhosgobel.blogspot.com/2004/11/tangled-bank-16.html">Tangled Bank #16 is online at Rhosgobel</a>!</p>

<p>If you don't know what the Tangled Bank is, <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">you can read the explanation at Tangled Bank Central</a>. It's a biweekly collection of science stories, hosted by webloggers. Go there to find <i>lots</i> of articles on all kinds of science. Submit your own stories. Volunteer to be a host. It's our attempt to propagate more attention to science in the blogosphere.</p>

<p>If you still don't get it, send <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">email to me</a> and ask questions. If you get it and think this is a wonderful idea, <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">volunteer</a> to help out. It takes people to build a pro-science network, and we're always looking for more enthusiasts.</p>
