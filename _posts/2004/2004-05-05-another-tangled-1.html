<p>I would like to draw everyone's attention to a broad-based attempt to incite more general science-based weblogging, the <a href="http://tangledbank.net">Tangled Bank</a>, and <a href="http://invasivespecies.blogspot.com/2004_05_02_invasivespecies_archive.html#108377184461014655">the latest entry in a biweekly series of science links</a>, at <a href="http://invasivespecies.blogspot.com/">The Invasive Species Weblog</a>. Read it and follow the links, and just as importantly, submit your work to <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a>.</p>
