I have \[URL =http://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2004/12/one-nation-under-designer.html#comments\]blogged\[/URL\] an \[URL = http://www.pdkintl.org/kappan/k_v86/k0412ter.htm\]article in Phi Beta Kappa\[/URL\], the online magazine of the Professional Association of Educators, on the true significance for education and society of the Wedge Strategy on my \[URL = http://evolvethought.blogspot.com/\]Evolving Thoughts blog.\[/URL\]

The article, by educator Mark Terry, who works just down the road from the Disco, sorry, Discovery Institute, covers Huxley and religion and is a piece worth reading.
