A common charge of anti-evolutionists is to say "but what are the <i>chances</i> of this all happening by mechanistic and unguided processes?" Well, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16991">in this article</a> (which I saw on <i><a href="http://www.aldaily.com">Arts & Letters Daily</a></i>), Freeman Dyson explains <b>"Littlewood's Law of Miracles,"</b> which <b>"states that in the course of any normal person's life, miracles happen at a rate of roughly one per month."</b> Reminds me of how <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt.cgi?__mode=view&_type=entry&blog_id=2&id=83&saved_added=1&ping_errors=1">Richard Feynman</a> used to put it. "Today on the freeway, I drove behind a car whose license plate was 3SVD543. Can you imagine how small the <i>chances</i> are of that happening?"

For more on the unremarkability of extremely rare coincidences, see chapter 7 of Richard Dawkins' magnificent <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0618056734/qid=1080751625/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-4265652-7651008?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Unweaving The Rainbow.</i></a>
