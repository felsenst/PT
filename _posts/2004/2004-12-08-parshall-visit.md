Unfortunately, I guess, the producer of "Janet Parshall's America" called me up and cancelled my appearance on the show tomorrow, saying "they were going in a different direction" because of some "breaking news."  I thanked him and asked him to keep me in mind, but I got the feeling ( I may be wrong) that the  opportunity has passed me by. Oh well ....  (It will be interesting to see who/what they have replaced me with.)

I think, however, that the little summary that I wrote [here](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000641.html) was worth the time - it helped me articulate my position, and I think I will have the opportunity to make the same points elsewhere, possible in more important venues.

Thanks to all who offered me support and advice.
