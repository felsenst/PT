<p>There was <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000095.html#669">a question in one of the comments</a> about any responses to <a href="http://www.ostp.gov/html/ucs.html">Marburger's reply</a> to the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_environment/rsi/report.html">Union of Concerned Scientist's report</a> on the corruption of science policy under Bush. The answer is yes; <a href="http://pharyngula.org/comments/549_0_1_0_C/">I've said a few words about it</a>, but the best reply is to be found on <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp#694">Chris Mooney's site</a>. His summary:</p>

<blockquote>In my view, there are serious problems both with Marburger's strategy for rebutting the barrage of scientific charges against the administration, and with his specific rebuttal itself. Granted, Marburger scores a couple of points against the administration's critics. But these are really glancing blows. For the most part, the UCS document still stands relatively intact.</blockquote>

<p>Really, though, this is one where you need to <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp#694">read the details</a>.</p>
