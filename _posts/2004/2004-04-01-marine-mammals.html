Date:    Wed, 31 Mar 2004 10:49:01 -0800
<br/>From:    MARMAM Editors <marmamed@uvic.ca>
<br/>Subject: MMC beaked whale technical workshop (fwd)

<p>--Apologies for cross-postings--

<p>The Marine Mammal Commission is planning a workshop to discuss the
vulnerability of beaked whales to anthropogenic sound.  The
workshop will be held at the Renaissance Harborplace Hotel in Baltimore,
Maryland from 13 April to 16 April 2004.

<p>The workshop will be technical in nature and will inform the larger policy
dialogue sponsored by the Marine Mammal Commission on the effects of
anthropogenic sound in the marine environment (see www.mmc.gov/sound for
more information). Specifically, the workshop's goals are to (1) assess current
knowledge of recent stranding events involving beaked whales and their
biology and ecology; (2) identify and characterize factors that may have
caused those strandings; (3) identify data needed to investigate possible
cause-and-effect relationships; and (4) recommend research, management, and
mitigation strategies specific to beaked whales and acoustic impacts.

<p>To guide preparation for the workshop, the Commission appointed a steering
committee consisting of Jay Barlow, Lee Benner, Bob Gisiner, Lloyd Lowry,
Jim Mead, Teri Rowles, and Doug Wartzok.  The steering committee felt that
to facilitate discussion, we needed to limit the number of participants at
the table. The Commission has invited 30 individuals who will be involved in
this discussion.  However, the workshop will be open to observers, and the
general public are welcome to attend.

<p>An agenda and additional information will be posted when available on the
Marine Mammal Commission's web site
(http://mmc.gov/sound/beakedwhalewrkshp.html). Please feel free to forward
this to anyone who may find this workshop useful and may be
interested in attending.  Questions can be addressed to Dr. Tara Cox,
Assistant Scientific Program Director, Marine Mammal Commission, phone
301-504-0087, email tcox@mmc.gov.
