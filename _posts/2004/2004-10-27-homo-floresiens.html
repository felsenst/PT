<p>A long-lost cousin has been discovered, <i>Homo floresiensis</i>, or Flores Man. It's especially dramatic for a number of reasons. It's relatively recent, with the youngest specimen only 18,000 years old, but it is most closely related to <i>Homo erectus</i>. This species was also minute, only 3 feet tall, and tiny-brained. Here we have a group of small, specialized human relatives, living contemporaneously with <i>Homo sapiens</i>, on isolated islands in Indonesia. It's like discovering that Munchkins were real.
