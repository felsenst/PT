The Presbyterian Church of New Zealand [recently reviewed](http://www.presbyterian.org.nz/2415.0.html) one of Dembski's latest books,  _The Design Revolution_.  The reviewer, Alistair McBride, is a former science teacher and current minister.  He has this to say about the book.

> For me the book is characterised by a great deal of polemic and special pleading which makes it difficult to tread a path through the argumentation.
> 
> His real target is something he calls Darwinism. As I read the chapter "The Only Game in Town" I found he tries to narrow the debate down to a particular understanding of what Darwin wrote. . . .
> 
> . . . From my reading, the branch of evolutionary biology has come to see that "natural selection" plays only a part in the overall scheme of the theory of evolution and to argue solely against a narrowly defined Darwinist position obfuscates the issues being discussed in the wider scientific community.

Thanks to Glenn Branch for the heads up.
