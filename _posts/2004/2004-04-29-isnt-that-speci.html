<p>Have you ever heard of the <a href="http://www.manminresearch.org/index_eng.html">Manmin Research Center, and the Jaerock Lee Ministry</a>? Neither have I, but William Dembski has&mdash;and he's been following it for years. He has recently even endorsed it.</p>

<blockquote><p>The ministry of the Manmin Church is quite remarkable, and I have been following it now for several years. As a scientist, I tend to be skeptical about events that are supposed to be miracles. Yet as a Christian, I also know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that there is nothing to prevent the power of God from working miraculous events. Having visited the Manmin Church and having seen the news reports of Rev. Dr. Jae-Rock Lee's ministry around the globe, I am persuaded that God truly is manifesting himself with works of power through this ministry. There is a great need for people to experience the power of God in their lives. I therefore commend "Manmin World News" for emphasizing this aspect of the Christian life that is so often neglected in the West.</p>
