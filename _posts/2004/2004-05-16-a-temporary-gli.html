<p>I've noticed that a lot of people are using the badges for the Panda's Thumb (and good for you!) that I host on my site, pharyngula.org, and some of the graphics in my articles here are similarly hosted there. You may find that those graphics aren't available today: my server is offline for the next several hours while some major electrical work is done on my campus. My apologies, and we expect everything to come back online by late this afternoon or early evening, Central Time.</p>

<p>(Oh, and Pharyngula will also be unavailable during that time.)</p>
