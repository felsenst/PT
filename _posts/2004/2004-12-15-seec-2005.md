# First Call for Abstracts

Southeastern Ecology and Evolution Conference
The University of Georgia
Athens, Georgia
11-13 March 2005
http://www.uga.edu/seec

Registration deadline:  4 February 2005

We invite all graduate, undergraduate, and post-doctoral researchers studying in the environmental and life sciences to submit abstracts for either oral or poster presentations at the 2nd annual Southeastern Ecology and Evolution Conference (SEEC) to be held March 11-13, 2005, at the The University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.  Talks will be delivered by Drs. Whit Gibbons, John Avise and Gary Barrett.

SEEC is a professional meeting intended for students in the environmental and life sciences to present their research to their colleagues in a comfortable, fun, and low stress environment.  Such events are designed to encourage new friendships within our field and to share newly developed research ideas for feedback.  While we expect most SEEC participants to be from the Southeast, we encourage and welcome all interested individuals to submit abstracts and/or attend. 

To encourage attendance, registration is only $15 and covers meeting attendance, two continental breakfasts, snacks, coffee, a t-shirt, and $100 cash awards for the best oral and poster presentations.  The early registration and abstract submission deadline is February 4, 2005, and may be completed at the following web site:
