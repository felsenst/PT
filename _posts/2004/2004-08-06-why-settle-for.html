<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/">Les Lane</a> sent me a link to a weird, funny, and distressing story: <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/0806rally.asp">Motorcyclists to show support for Creation Museum</a>. It's from Answers in Genesis, which tells you a lot right there...</p>
<p>Anyway, it's several motorcyclists showing their support with a rally for the brand new <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/">creation 'science' museum</a> that Answers in Genesis is building in Kentucky. I guess if you can't get scientific support, you can always find a few bikers. Maybe some of them are named <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3541_project_steve_2_16_2003.asp">Steve</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a discouraging bit of news from the end of the article, though:</p>
<blockquote>The <b>$25-million</b> museum project has passed the halfway mark for donations (an <b>$800,000 museum donation</b> was recently received from a long-time AiG supporter), and exhibit design continues in earnest.  The AiG staff of 85 plans to move into the administrative side of the complex in a few weeks; the museum has a faith promise opening timeframe of spring 2007.</blockquote>
That is truly depressing, that ignorance can accumulate that much money and throw it away on propaganda. I wonder what kind of good work the <a href="http://ncseweb.org/">NCSE</a> could do with 25 million dollars?</p>
