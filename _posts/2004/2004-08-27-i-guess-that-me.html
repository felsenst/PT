<p>The Sarkar Lab at U Texas Austin is maintaining a <a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/001899.html">Hall of Shame</a>, a list of faculty who "must believe that creationism in one of its guises provides a better explanation of biotic change than contemporary evolutionary theory". The list so far is short, and includes the name of the person nominating the faculty member. Bill Dembski is one of the three (the others are RC Koons and J Budziszewski), and the bizarre thing is that he nominated himself.</p>

<p>We can therefore take it on good authority that Dembski is a creationist; I wonder if he'll take exception to the nomination, though?</p>
