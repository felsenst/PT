<a href="http://wam.umd.edu/~south/2004_06_13_archives.html#108740534072372876">Tangled Bank #5</a> is now online at <a href="http://wam.umd.edu/~south/">Borneo Chela</a>. This time around we have a solid evolutionary theme going, but that isn't always going to be the case: if you've written anything on biology, natural history, or medicine, send it in to <a href="mailto:host@tangledbank.net">host@tangledbank.net</a> for the next edition, which will be hosted by <a href="http://www.crumpled.com/cp/personal/">Johnny Logic</a> on 30 June.</p>
