We at the Panda's Thumb would like to develop an open submission policy to encourage guest contributions to our blog.  We are currently looking at a two stage process.  First abstracts are submitted and if accepted a full length post will follow.  We are also looking into having a way for readers to alert us to news stories that we may have missed.

Now, the purpose of this post is to get feedback on this idea from the community.  If you have any suggestions on how to structure the open submission policy, we'd like to hear from you in the comments.
