<p>There is an <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/justscience/petition.htm">online petition for UK citizens to protest creationism in education</a>. Sign it if you agree with this statement:</p>

<blockquote>We, the undersigned, feel it is an inappropriate use of taxpayer's money (and inappropriate within the UK National Science Curriculum) to teach religion in the science classrooms of UK schools. We feel is more appropriate that religion be taught as a separate subject from science. We want religion taught as a separate subject from science and the science taught to our (the nation's) children to reflect our scientist's current best understanding of the world & universe around us.</blockquote>
