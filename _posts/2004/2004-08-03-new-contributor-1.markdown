Please raise your glasses in a toast to welcome the Panda's Thumb's newest patron, Jim Foley. For those who have observed or participated in the evolution/creationism debate online for any period of time, Jim needs no introduction. He is the author of the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/">Fossil Hominids</a> website in the TalkOrigins Archive, an incredibly thorough examination of the evidence for human evolution and equally thorough debunking of the creationist claims on the subject. Jim is a software engineer by training and, like any good Aussie, we expect him to more than hold his own at the PT drinking games. Welcome to the group, Jim.
