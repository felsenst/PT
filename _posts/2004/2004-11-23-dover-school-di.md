The long-awaited decision of the Dover Area School District in Pennsylvania regarding evolution and intelligent design has finally been released to the public (press release found [here](http://www.dover.k12.pa.us/doversd/cwp/view.asp?A=3&amp;Q=261852)). It's a policy that virtually guarantees legal action that the school district will lose. Let's take a look at the statement. After noting that their biology classes will be using the Prentice-Hall textbook _Biology_ as their primary textbook, they said:

> The district also received as a donation 60 copies of Of Pandas and People and the book is now listed as a reference book in the curriculum.  It is not a required text, but in an effort to present a balanced curriculum the book is made available to all students who wish to review the book.

The Biology curriculum was also updated to include the following statement:

> _"Students will be made aware of gaps/problems in Darwin's Theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to Intelligent Design. The Origins of Life is not taught."_
