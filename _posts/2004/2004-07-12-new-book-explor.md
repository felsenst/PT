The Pulitzer Prize winning [Edward J. Larson](http://www.lawsch.uga.edu/academics/profiles/larson.html) has a new book,  [Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679642889/qid=1089666496/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/104-6684831-1819143?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846).  He teaches both history and law at [the University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu).  His background is in the history of science, specifically biology.

> "Everyone will agree, whether you like it or not, the theory of evolution is one of the most important concepts of the last 200 years," Larson said. "Whether you like it or not, it influences what we think about the world, even for people who don't accept the theory or all of the theory of evolution. It still influences society, the culture in which they operate and influences a lot of other people, and therefore it impacts our society. And yet, I couldn't find a book that told the story of its history, full of its controversies, full of the objections, full of the implications as a story that normal people like you and I could read, rather than a technical work of science that is really dry."
