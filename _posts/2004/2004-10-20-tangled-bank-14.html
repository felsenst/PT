<p>We have another <a href="http://prashantmullick.com/wlog/archives/2004/10/20/tangled-bank-14/">Tangled Bank&mdash;#14</a> is online at <a href="http://prashantmullick.com/wlog/">Prashant Mullick's Weblog</a>. He had me worried for a while that darn few submissions were coming in, but as usual, there was a last-minute flurry and we have an entertaining and diverse assemblage of biology posts.</p>

<p>There will be more to come at <a href="http://www.6thinternational.org/">The Sixth International</a> in two weeks, so send us those links. Also, I'm still looking for more hosts, so if you're willing to collect and organize a few web links, <a href="mailto:pzmyers@pharyngula.org">volunteer</a>!</p>
