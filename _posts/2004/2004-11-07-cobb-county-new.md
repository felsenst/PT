A couple of news articles about the upcomming trial of the anti-evolution messages in Cobb County (GA) textbooks:

# Update

A couple of Discovery Institute links

[Background Information on Cobb Country Georgia Court Case](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2290&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Science%20and%20Education%20Policy%20-%20State%20Policy)

[Georgia Scientists File Legal Brief in Evolution Lawsuit, Defend Open-Minded Approach to Teaching Evolution](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2289&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News)

(I've read the brief, and it is bad, very bad.  Even cites Behe and Snoke (2004) as research questioning evolution.)
