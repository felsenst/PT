After a slightly longer hiatus than I originally intended, EvolutionBlog is now back to regular posting!  I update the blog Sundays through Thursdays, usually in the evenings.  The idea is that if you stop by Monday-Friday you won't miss naything (perish the thought).

I just completed my analysis of Cornelius Hunter's essay from <I>Uncommon Dissent</I>.

Part one is available <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2004/08/hunter-part-one.html>here</A>.

Part two is available <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2004/08/hunter-part-2.html>here</A>.

Part three is available <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2004/08/hunter-part-3.html>here</A>.

Next up: Tipler!
