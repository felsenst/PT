<p>The Discovery Institute is touting their new book that they purport <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2157&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Scholarship%20-%20Science%20-%20MainPage">"shows [the] influence of Darwinian principles on Hitler's Nazi regime"</a> (I think you'll be hearing more about this book here soon). I'm wondering about something, though. If they so deplore Hitler's racism, why have they been using a publisher whose main claim to fame is the publication of right-wing anti-Clinton diatribes, and whose heir the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/connecting_a_few_dots/">"prime mover and shaker in white nationalism publishing" and supporter of "white-supremacist luminaries"</a>?</p>
