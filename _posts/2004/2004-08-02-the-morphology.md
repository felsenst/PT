[The National Center for Science Education's](http://www.ncseweb.org/) [Project Steve](http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18) now has a published paper appearing in the estimable journal, "The Annals of Improbable Research" (AIR).

Eugenie Scott, Nick Matzke, Glenn Branch, and some 430 odd Steves comprise the author list as [Project Steve T-shirt order](http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/2952_the_tshirt_2_16_2003.asp) information is bent, folded, stapled, and otherwise mutilated to obtain such findings as "island dwarfism in Steves" and the infamous "mid-continental Steve deficit".

I play an unacknowledged role in the paper as the model in the "experimental Steveometry apparatus".
