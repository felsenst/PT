>  Young supports a recent board recommendation that calls for "removing anything (from reading lists) that provides a neutral or positive view of immorality or foul language."
> 
> But some in the southern Maryland county are upset, fearing that some board members are attempting to impose personal religious and moral beliefs on the public schools.

> They point to the book list and a proposal that recommends distributing Bibles in schools, **removing science books "biased towards evolution"** and teaching sexual education classes focused exclusively on abstinence.
>
