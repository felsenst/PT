I had originally conceived of the idea to compare and contrast anti-evolutionist responses to National Geographic's recent piece on evolution.  The point was to hopefully demonstrate similarities between "young-earth" creationism and "intelligent-design" creationism.  With limited time available to do this, I think I'll just provide a collection of links and let the readers for now draw their own conclusions.
