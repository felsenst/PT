<p>An essay by Wesley R. Elsberry and Dave E. Thomas

<p>The phrase "dogmatic Darwinists" has become a commonplace in
antievolutionary writings.  We are going to examine what is meant
by the use of this phrase and why it is simply a dismissive
rhetorical tactic employed by the antievolutionists, who otherwise
would actually have to address the substantive arguments and
persuasive evidence presented by biologists.

<p>The following examples show the actual use of the
charge of "dogmatic Darwinism" being made by various
anti-evolutionists.

<p>Let me issue a three-part "prophecy" about Johnson and his
feisty new book: (1) During the coming year, Johnson's name
will become a "household word" to millions of Americans. (2)
Dogmatic Darwinists will come to regard the Berkeley professor
as their chief enemy because of the painful intellectual blows
that Darwin on Trial deals to their cherished evolutionary
world view. (3) Evangelical Christians of all stripes will
welcome his critique, and some will sense the rise of a new
C.S. Lewis in our time.

<p><blockquote>

<p>Another tip-off was the sharp contrast I noticed between
the extremely dogmatic tone that Darwinists use when
addressing the general public and the occasional frank
acknowledgments, in scientific circles, of serious problems
with the theory. For example, I would read Stephen Jay Gould
telling the scientific world that Darwinism was effectively
dead as a theory. And then in the popular literature, I would
read Gould and other scientific writers saying that Darwinism
was fundamentally healthy, and that scientists had the
remaining problems well under control. There was a
contradiction here, and it looked as though there was an
effort to keep the outside world from becoming aware of the
serious intellectual difficulties.

<p><blockquote>

<p>"Dogmatic Darwinists claim that nothing in biology makes
sense except in the light of evolution," said Wells, a Senior
Fellow of Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of
Science and Culture. "Then they misrepresent the evidence to
promote their view. The truth is, nothing in biology makes
sense except in the light of evidence."

<p><blockquote>

<p>To believers in creation, the Darwinists seem thoroughly
intolerant and dogmatic when they insist that their own
philosophy must have a monopoly in the schools and the
media. The Darwinists do not see themselves that way, of
course. On the contrary, they often feel aggrieved when
creationists (in either the broad or narrow sense) ask to have
their own arguments heard in public and fairly considered. To
insist that schoolchildren be taught that Darwinian evolution
is a fact is in their minds merely to protect the integrity of
science education; to present the other side of the case would
be to allow fanatics to force their opinions on others.

<p>So, what does it take for someone to be labeled a "dogmatic
Darwinist"?  By examination of its deployment, it is clear that there
is no particular standard applied.  In many cases, there is no effort
made to even specify who might - or might not - be meant to be covered
by the label.  Essentially, the simple fact that a scientist rejects
the arguments of the antievolutionists or actively opposes
antievolutionary politics is sufficient to lead to the application of
the phrase.  In the examples above, there is no evidence that any
extensive argument is made that the phrase is correctly applied to a
particular person.  Instead, the accusation is taken as its own proof.
In the last example given above, the accusation is deployed as a
pre-emptive measure - any argument from the accused that they are
simply defending well-supported findings and well-tested theories is
taken as confirmation of the correctness of the accusation.

<p>If the use of "dogmatic Darwinist" were to be justified, one would
see evidence presented that the person so labeled is both dogmatic and
a "Darwinist" as Darwinist is used in the biological context.  This is
where it becomes clear that use of the phrase is simply rhetoric, for
no such case is ever forthcoming.

<p>The deployment of "dogmatic Darwinists" is easily seen to be an
<i>ad hominem</i> argument: an assertion concerning the person is
given instead of a rebuttal of the argument.  It is noteworthy that
many antievolutionary activists are hyper-sensitive to <i>ad
hominem</i> when they suspect it is being used against them.  Often,
they will claim that an opponent has engaged in <i>ad hominem</i>
argumentation when they actually haven't.  In "Defeating Darwinism",
Phillip E. Johnson explores the utility of examining possible bias
on the part of an opponent:

<p><blockquote>

<p>In this imperfect world an ad hominem argument sometimes
performs the legitimate function of showing that a person has
a bias and hence that his or her arguments should be examined
carefully.  The argument is misused if it does more than that,
causing us to ignore worthwhile arguments because of what we
think of the person making them.  The point is to recognize
and acknowledge bias, and then get beyond it to evaluate the
evidence fairly.

<p>- Phillip E. Johnson, "Defeating Darwinism", p. 41

</blockquote>

<p>Given Johnson's stance, the question to be answered is whether
the antievolutionists deploying the "dogmatic Darwinist" phrase
show any inclination to get beyond "recognizing bias" to fairly
deal with the evidence and arguments presented by the so-called
"dogmatic Darwinists".  It seems clear to us that
the answer is, "No."  This applies even to Johnson himself.

<p>As a rhetorical weapon, the antievolutionists rely upon the
negative associations of the adjective "dogmatic".  Additionally, the
use of a term with an "-ism" suffix tends to evoke associations with
terms used in politics, social studies, or religion rather than
science.  When one considers the broader context of scientific
knowledge, though, this can easily be seen to be inaccurate and
misleading:

<p><blockquote>

<p>Because to revile evolutionary science, 140 years after the
Darwin-Wallace insight, as 'Darwinism' is ignorance or
rabble-rousing. It is as silly as would be sneering at NASA's space
engineering as 'Newtonism' (which in the same trivial sense it is).

<p>- Paul R. Gross, "Politicizing Science Education", a Thomas B.
Fordham Foundation report, http://www.edexcellence.net/library/gross.html

</blockquote>

<p>Calling evolutionary scientists "Darwinists" is simply a way of
marginalizing mainstream science and scientists.  The same could be said
about the term "evolutionists," as it carries the connotation of someone
fighting for belief in evolution (religious-style) instead of scientists
working on evolution, whether it be biologists, geologists,
paleontologists, biochemists, etc.

<p>Making something an "ism" is a way of making it "religious" - in the sense
that it, being labelled a religious belief itself, can be opposed on the
grounds of other religious beliefs, and not hard scientific facts.  "Isms"
take the debate out of science and into socio-politics.

<p>Evolutionary scientists are not just "Darwinists," or "evolutionists," but
rather biologists, chemists, paleontologists, geologists, geochemists,
biochemists, physical geologists, physical chemists, and so forth.  The
debate is not between creationism and evolutionism.  The debate is between
antievolutionism and science -- <b>all</b> of science.
