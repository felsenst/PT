Richard von Sternberg has created <A HREF=http://www.rsternberg.net>this website</A> to reply to the various criticisms of his editorial judgment in publishing Stephen Meyer's ID paper in <I>The Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington</I>.

I read with great interest what he had to say, and I have posted a reply in <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com/2004/09/sternberg-replies.html>this post</A> over at <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</A>.  It seems to me that at times his phrasing is just a bit too cagey, and his reply leaves me wondering about a number of things.
