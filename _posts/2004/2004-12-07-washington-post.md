[Fresh Challenges in the Old Debate Over Evolution](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40839-2004Dec6.html)

> David Jackson's life straddles all the fault lines in the battle over the teaching of evolution in public schools.
> 
> Jackson is a professor of science education at the University of Georgia's College of Education in Athens. He believes to his core that science has proved valid Charles Darwin's theory of how life on Earth developed from a common ancestry and why life has such diversity.
> 
> About half the students he teaches to become middle school science instructors -- and to teach evolution themselves -- believe that God created the Earth 6,000 years ago, he said. Scientist friends tell him not to teach those students because anyone with those beliefs "shouldn't teach." But he tells them it is his job to make sure that his students understand evolution, not believe it.

Of course the problem with the title is that ID is not actually a fresh argument.
