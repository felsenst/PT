Following <A HREF=http://pharyngula.org/comments/525_0_1_0_C/>Pharyngula's lead</A> I have read the current <A HREF=http://www.worldmag.com/world/issue/04-03-04/cover_1.asp>cover story</A> of <I>World</I> magazine.  In it, the editors asked four contributors to imagine a future time, 2025 to be exact, when ID has replaced evolution.  They are to write essays explaining how this change took place.

Pharyngula has already written an admirable dissection of Jonathan Wells' fantasies.  Over at <A HREF=http://evolutionblog.blogspot.com>EvolutionBlog</A> I offer my thoughts on Phillip Johnson's contribution.

In next few days I will have a look at Dembski's and Schwartz's contributions, unless other bloggers beat me to it, of course.
