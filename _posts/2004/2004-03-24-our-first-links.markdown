The Panda's Thumb is already getting some notice around the blogosphere. Our first few links:

Kieran Healy of <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org">Crooked Timber</a> recommends us as a <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001576.html">follow up</a> to a brief review of the Brian Leiter/Lawrence VanDyke controversy.

Brian Leiter has also given us a <a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/bleiter/000997.html">plug</a>, along with his usual plainspoken bluntness.

And Tim Sandefur of the <a href="http://sandefur.blogspot.com/">Freespace</a> blog gives us a <a href="http://sandefur.blogspot.com/2004_03_21_sandefur_archive.html#108011433684188575">push</a>, while taking us to task, as a self-declared "hardcore Dawkins fan", for choosing a Gouldian title. I know that Tim is also a major Daniel Dennett fan as well, but I didn't tell him that one of the possible names I was bandying about for this blog was "Darwin's Dangerous Idea Logs". 

Thanks for the links, folks.

<b><u>Update</u>:</b> Thanks also to <a href="http://skepticalnotion.blogspot.com/2004_03_21_skepticalnotion_archive.html#108014576540103844">Skeptical Notion</a> for their mention of The Panda's Thumb.

And add <a href="http://www.badanalysis.com/catallaxy/archives/000138.html">Catallaxy</a> to the list.
