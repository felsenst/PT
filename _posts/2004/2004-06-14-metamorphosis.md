The Panda's Thumb will be going through some changes.  Where we once were a bland caterpillar, we are going to emerge soon as a beautiful, elegant butterfly.  (Or nasty maggot to shit-eating fly, take your pick.)  Some might say that PT is evolving, but no we are developing, growing into adulthood.  We will have fur where there wasn't fur before, our voice will deepen, and might even grow a breast or two.  So please bear with us as we make the changes.
