Brian Leiter has a <a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/bleiter/001112.html">post</a> up about the reactions of some Federalist Society members concerning the recent Van Dyke flare-up.

<blockquote><p>A distinguished legal scholar and well-known Federalist Society figure reacted to <a href="http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/bleiter/001104.html">my recent comments</a> on Stuart Buck and Lawrence VanDyke, in which I quipped that they seem "intent on making sure the Federalist Society gets a reputation as a hotbed of dense apologists for Intelligent Design." This reader objects:

"[H]olding the Federalist Society responsible for idiotic design people in its midst is like holding the Democratic Party responsible for Larouchies. [...]</p></blockquote>

Youch!  It's quite an interesting issue, but I think it's worth noting that many conservatives care little for the ID movement, despite the fact that ID was originally conceived for the express purpose of <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html">advocating a strain of conservative ideology</a>.  Can't blame 'em.
