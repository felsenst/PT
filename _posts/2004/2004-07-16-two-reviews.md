Two new reviews about books critiquing the ID movement:  

[The first](http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opbooks.jsp?id=ns24564) is a short dual review of _Why Intelligent Design Fails_ and _The Cultures of Creationism_, appearing in _New Scientist_ magazine.  PT's own Matt Young is coeditor of the first.  

[The second](http://www.stnews.org/books_id_0704.html) is a review of _Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design_, appearing in _Science and Theology News_.  Our own Paul Gross is coauthor of this book.  

Thanks to Glenn Branch for the heads-up.
