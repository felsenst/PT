Remember Cassini, the multibillion dollar spaceship we put in orbit around Saturn back in July?  (If not, see the PT posts [Say hello to Phoebe](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000266.html) and [First decent views of the surface of Titan](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000312.html), and the [Cassini website](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm)).

Cassini will pass within 746 _miles_ of Titan -- a mere 10 hour drive on the freeway -- and snap up close photos, and image the surface in detail with atmosphere-penetrating radar.

Here is a photo taken during approach (last Sunday, October 24), with a special filter to peer through the smog:

The flyby happened some hours ago, but the raw images are coming in (the Cassini webpage [Raw image archive](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/index.cfm) seems a bit sluggish, all of us spacegeeks must be checking it) and more importantly, at about 6:30 p.m. PST., the [Titan Flyby Webcast](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/webcast/cassini/) will occur from JPL for those of us who don't get NASA TV.
