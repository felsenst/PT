William A. Dembksi, mathematician, philosopher, and theologian, now has his next job lined up.

Dembski is moving east, to the [Southern Baptist Theological Seminary](http://www.sbts.edu/) in Louisville, Kentucky. He will head up the newly formed "Center for Science and Theology" there.

This story was scooped by Jeff Robinson at the [Baptist Press News](http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=19115). 

> Southern Baptist Theological Seminary President R. Albert Mohler Jr. announced Sept. 16 the establishment of the Center for Science and Theology along with the appointment of renowned philosopher of science William A. Dembski as its first director.

William A. Dembski wrote:

> "Theology is where my ultimate passion is and I think that is where I can uniquely contribute ... I am looking forward to engaging students and theological students have always been my favorite to deal with because for theology students, it's not just a job, but a passion, especially at a place like Southern, because they want to change the world."
