Kevin Padian, of the Department of Integrative Biology & Museum of Paleontology at University of California, Berkeley, recently dashed off a letter to colleagues titled "**STARS OF V.P. PUNKED BY CREATIONIST FILMMAKERS**."

\[_VP is "Vertebrate Paleontology."_\]  What's the beef?  Padian wrote the following on Nov. 18th:

While this 'punking' may be a first for the vertebrate paleo crowd, it's certainly not the first such devious effort.  Here's one involving [biologists and our own P. Z. Myers](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/im-gonna-be-a-m.html).

Discuss.
