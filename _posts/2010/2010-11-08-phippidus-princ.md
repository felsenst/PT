<big>_Phippidus princeps_ -- [jumping spider](http://www.cirrusimage.com/spider_Phidippus_princeps.htm) -- munching on _Eupeodes_ sp. -- [hoverfly](http://bugguide.net/node/view/11609/bgimage).</big> Mr. Deneslbeck ("Just Al" to PT readers) is a naturalist and semi-professional photographer. He writes, "Nothing endangered, remarkable, or of particular scientific interest to either of these, I just liked the photo.  I haven't defined why jumping spiders seem to have more personality than other species of arachnid, including those with two distinct eyes in the front, but I don't think I'm alone."  He runs a website [here](http://wading-in.net/) and recently posted a favorable review of my very favorite book [here](http://wading-in.net/walkabout/2010/11/book-review-why-evolution-works-and-creationism-fails/).
