Some of you might be thinking about using this to clone me.  But I own the copyright to myself so you can't do anything!

I'm busy clubbin' with some seal friends of mine right now and haven't had the time my species needs to digest such monumental work.  I recommend [Matthew Cobb's take on the giant panda genome](http://z-letter.com/2010/01/20/the-panda-revealed/).
