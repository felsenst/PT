**UPDATE**  It turns out that the documents were _not_ officially released.  I have therefore asked NCSE to take them down and they've done so.  I was misled by a posting on [Accountability in the Media](http://www.accountabilityinthemedia.com/2010/09/freshwaters-closing-arguments.html) which said Hamilton's brief "was released Thursday" (Sep 17).  I inferred that it had been released by R. Lee Shepherd, the referee and that all the documents were publishable.  It now turns out that's not the case; Shepherd has not yet released the documents.

========================

~~The five final documents submitted to the referee of the administrative hearing on John Freshwater's termination are [up on NCSE's site](http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/freshwater-termination-hearing).  They are the Board of Education's summary brief, Freshwater's summary brief, the Board's reply to Freshwater's summary, Freshwater's reply to the Board's summary, and an _amicus_ brief submitted by the Dennises.  

Happy reading!~~
