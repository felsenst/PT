Steve Matheson, who has been sparring with IDists about their misrepresentations regarding "junk" DNA, has started a series of posts about introns at [Quintessence of Dust](http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/) that's pitched at the intelligent lay person level and is highly recommended.  [Part 1](http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/06/introns-lets-think-about-this-people.html) and [Part 2](http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2010/06/introns-lets-think-about-this-people_29.html) are up so far.
