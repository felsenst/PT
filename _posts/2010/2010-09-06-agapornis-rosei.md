<big>_Agapornis roseicollis_ -- [Rosy-faced Lovebirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy-faced_Lovebird).</big> _A. roseicollis_ have established a large and growing feral population in the Phoenix metro area. The Sonoran desert habitats serve them very well, and they're thriving on a diet composed largely of mesquite beans and nesting in cavities in the saguaros or in the spaces under roof tiles.
