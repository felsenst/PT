What we got in the mail:

I would like to alert you and invite you (and hopefully your readers) to attend a NASA-sponsored workshop on the origin of life - but you don't have to leave home.

This three day workshop, "Molecular Paleontology and Resurrection: Rewinding the Tape of Life", will be streamed live over the web. The workshop is open to the worldwide science community. It will be accessible via internet browser, no special software or equipment is required. Questions can be submitted to speakers by chat software. This is a new type of scientific conference with a low carbon footprint, no registration fees, and no hassle of travel. The low barrier to attendance makes it reasonable for scientists outside of this direct line of research, and the non-scientist lay public, to attend what would normally be a highly restricted meeting.

We already have registrants from 15 countries, so this format really does indeed provide a high level of accessibility.

The meeting is:
November 8, 9 & 10, 1PM - 5PM EST - That's next week!!!!

The program is [here](http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/ool-www/program/):
