The Texas State Board of Education is making the final votes today on their controversial social studies curriculum.  This vote will have ramifications across the nations as most K--12 textbooks are written to appease the standards in Texas.  The board members are not curriculum experts, but partisan politicians, and have produced a set of social studies standards that seeks to promote a sectarian political viewpoint.  Some of you may remember their continual monkeying around with the science standards---no offense to actual monkeys.  But it takes some some chutzpa to remove [Thomas Jefferson](http://thomasjeffersonmovement.com/) from history standards.

[Texas Freedom Network](http://tfninsider.org/) is following today's events.
