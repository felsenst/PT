[Adrian Thysse flags](http://evolvingcomplexityii.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/evolution-education-and-outreach-new-edition-online/) the [December issue](http://www.springerlink.com/content/1936-6426/2/4/) of _Evolution: Education and Outreach_ and provides links to individual articles that are easier (for me, at least) to navigate than those on the journal site.  Some good stuff there.

**Correction:**  Turns out that Adrian's post came up in my reader this morning and I blasted right ahead not noticing that for some reason the reader had displayed Adrian's _2009_ post on that issue.  Sorry, folks.  (There's still some good stuff there, though.)
