Wesley Elsberry is beginning a series of indeterminate length dissecting Disco Dancer Casey Luskin's forthcoming 8-part series on ["Judge Jones's Misguided NCSE-Scripted Kitzmiller Ruling and the Origin of New Functional Genetic Information"](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/02/judge_joness_misguided_ncsescr.html).  Wesley's first sentence is a classic:

> Casey Luskin has decided to treat us to an agony in eight fits, wherein he will whine mightily concerning "information". I don't know how many of those I'll be taking note of, but I might as well have a look at the first one.

Go [read it all](http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2010/02/11/luskin-on-information-part-0) and comment there, please.

**Update**:  Mark Chu-Carroll has also [stepped on Casey](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/02/disco_strikes_out_again_casey.php).
