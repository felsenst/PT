In view of the Disco 'Tute's recent frantic braying against theistic evolution and evolutionary creationism (having joined [Ken Ham in that effort](http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2010/03/01/when-compromise-meets-compromise/)), Jeremy Mohn asks [Are God and Keplerism Compatible? Some Catholic, Jewish and Protestant Authors Say No](http://www.anevolvingcreation.net/standup/?p=875).  The book's blurb tells us that

> _God and Revolution_ includes chapters by Willard Rembski, author of _The Decline of Revolution_; Steve Meyerson, author of _Signature in the Solar System: Epicycles and the Evidence for Intelligent Design_; Denise O'Lambert, co-author of _The Spiraling Drain_; Davis Hoffenkling, editor of _Signature of Controversy: Responses to Critics of Signature in the Solar System_; John Wellington, author of _Icons of Revolution_; and Jonathan East, author of _Kepler Day in America_.  (John Pieret adds Casey Mustuvbeen, co-author of _Traipsing Into Revolution_.

Enjoy, and remember, _it's all about the science_!
