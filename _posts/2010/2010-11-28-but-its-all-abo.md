Most of our readers are no doubt aware of the recent near-expulsion of William A. Dembski from the ranks of true believers.  [This story](http://www.gofbw.com/news.asp?ID=12220&amp;fp=Y) in the Florida Baptist Witness covered it in some detail.  The basics:

1.  Dembski, now a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote an apologetics book in which he suggested that one can reconcile an old earth with the initiation of natural evil by a literal Fall of a real pair, Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden in the recent (~6,000 years) past by positing that the Fall echoed backward in time to tarnish all 4.5 billion years of earth's history (or some such blather).  Dembski mentioned _en passant_ that Da Flood was probably a local event, not a global deluge.

2.  Dembski was criticized for his apparent old earthism and deference to actual science in a book review by a faculty member at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dembski's former employer.

3.  After some to-ing and fro-ing involving (among others) the Presidents of the two seminaries, both of them young earthers, Dembski issued a clarification reiterating his belief in an inerrant Bible, etc., etc.

One thing I found of interest in this tempest in a theological teapot was Dembski's comment on his treatment the local/global flood issue.  He was quoted as writing

> "In a brief section \[of his book\] on Genesis 4-11, I weigh in on the Flood, raising questions about its universality, without adequate study or reflection on my part," Dembski wrote. "Before I write on this topic again, I have much exegetical, historical, and theological work to do."

Um, Bill?  You might consider that you have much _geological_ work to do.  After all, a putative global flood is geological event and geologists have been gathering relevant data for, oh, say, three centuries or so.  And this _is_ all about the science, isn't it?
