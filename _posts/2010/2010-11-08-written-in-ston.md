Some years ago I began following the blog of an undergraduate at Rutgers who split his posts between descriptions of work in paleontology and his problems getting a major put together in his preferred field of study.  Over the years it has been a real pleasure to watch as Brian Switek, the author of Laelaps ([first on Wordpress](http://laelaps.wordpress.com/), later [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/) and finally on [Wired's network](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/laelaps)) grew as an up and coming science writer and as a person.

Brian's first book, [Written in Stone: Evolution, the Fossil Record, and our Place in Nature](http://www.blpbooks.org/books/writteninstone.html) is coming out on December 1, and [NCSE has an excerpt](http://ncse.com/files/pub/evolution/Excerpt--writteninstone.pdf).  Sadly, it's not (yet?) available for my Nook (or for the Kindle) so I guess I'll have to wait a while to read the whole book.
