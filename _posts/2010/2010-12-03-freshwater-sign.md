Just a note to say that I've learned that John Freshwater did sign the settlement agreement with the Dennis family prior to it being approved (insofar as the terms relating to Zachary are concerned) by Licking County Juvenile Court Judge Hoover.  While the settlement agreement was negotiated by the Board's insurance company attorneys, Freshwater as the defendant had to sign off on it, and he did.  

AFAIK all that's left now is Federal Judge Gregory Frost's overall approval of the settlement and, of course, the concluding acts--referee's recommendation and Board of Education action on it--of the administrative hearing.  Then at last perhaps this sorry episode can be closed.

**Update:**  Judge Frost has signed off on the settlement.  See comment below.
