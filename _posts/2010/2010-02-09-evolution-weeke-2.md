Sorry to be so late, but February 12 is Charles Darwin's birthday, and February 12-14 is [Evolution Weekend](http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_evolution_weekend_2010.htm).  From the Evolution Weekend home page:


> Evolution Weekend is an opportunity for serious discussion and reflection on the relationship between religion and science. One important goal is to elevate the quality of the discussion on this critical topic - to move beyond sound bites. A second critical goal is to demonstrate that religious people from many faiths and locations understand that evolution is sound science and poses no problems for their faith. Finally, as with The Clergy Letters themselves, which have now been signed by more than 12,000 members of the clergy in the United States, Evolution Weekend makes it clear that those claiming that people must choose between religion and science are creating a false dichotomy.


If you live in a largish metropolitan area and know of any events that PT readers might want to attend, please announce them in the Comments.
