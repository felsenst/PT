The Sacramento Bee [has good pictures](http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/photos/2010/03/hunting-for-the-hobbit.html) of the Lianga Bua, Indonesia, site where _Homo floriesiensis_ remains have been found.  As you will notice, they're not just scraping the floor of a nice shallow cave with trowels.
