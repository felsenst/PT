A couple of months ago, I finished a first reading of Stephen Meyer's new book, _Signature in the Cell_.  It was very slow going because there is so much wrong with it, and I tried to take notes on everything that struck me.

Two things struck me as I read it:  first, its essential dishonesty, and second, Meyer's significant misunderstandings of information theory.  I'll devote a post to the book's many mispresentations another day, and concentrate on information theory today.  I'm not a biologist, so I'll leave a detailed discussion of what's wrong with his biology to others.

In _Signature in the Cell_, Meyer talks about three different kinds of information:  Shannon information, Kolmogorov information, and a third kind that has been invented by ID creationists and has no coherent definition.  I'll call the third kind "creationist information".
