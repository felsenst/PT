<big>[Sondre Stromfjord](http://travelingluck.com/North America/Greenland/Vestgrønland/_3419714_Søndre+Strømfjord.html) (Søndre Strømfjord), Greenland.</big> Mr. Schongalla writes, "View looking west down the fjord, from an altitude of approximately 500 m. The arctic is one of the environments most significantly affected by climate change. Greenland's icecap has experienced significant peripheral thinning. I am not a geologist, but my lay interpretation of this photograph is that it reflects a region that is primarily Archaean gneiss dated to 2.7-2.8 Ga. A striking, dark-colored band is visible on both sides of the fjord."
