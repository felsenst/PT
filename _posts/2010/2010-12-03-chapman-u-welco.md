I'm very proud to see that my alma mater, Chapman University, has [become the newest site for the Evolution Education Research Center's network.](http://chapmannews.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/chapman-teams-with-harvard-mcgill-in-evolution-center-expansion/) The announcement came last month at an event featuring Eugenie Scott of the NCSE. Congratulations to Prof. Brian Alters.

I'm particularly happy to see this because a few years ago, as readers will recall, the _Chapman Law Review_published a [terrible creationist article.](http://agaperevolution.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/trask_esi_clr.pdf) As an alumnus, I was so embarrassed to see the school's name on such a piece of tripe that I responded with [an article of my own.](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088905) It's nice to see Chapman step up for science!
