Dale McGowan, author of [Parenting Beyond Belief](http://www.parentingbeyondbelief.com/), has encountered a creationism-inclined science teacher in his son's school and is blogging the progress of his dealing with it.  So far there are two posts, [Science, Interrupted](http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=4504) and [Dear Mr. Taylor, Part 1](http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=4520).  Some of the commenters on his posts and that on the Friendly Atheist (linked below in the hat tip) are full of bravado and I hope McGowan ignores them.  You don't start with a flame-thrower.

So far McGowan is handling it well, emailing the teacher first (he's using email to retain a record of the interaction), and asking polite but clear questions.  What he has not done, or at least not mentioned he has done, is contact [NCSE](http://ncse.com) for advice, counsel, and support.  I've urged that in a comment on one of his posts and I here urge it publicly: Contact NCSE now, Dale!  There's no need to re-invent a wheel that's already on the ground and rolling.  NCSE exists _specifically_ for this kind of situation.

McGowan's experience reinforces the fact that stealth creationists are wide-spread in the public schools, busily infecting students with doubt about honest science.  As [one of the students who testified in the Freshwater hearing said](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/10/day-4-science-c.html), what he learned from Freshwater is that  science can't be trusted.  And it's public school teachers like Freshwater and McGowan's "Mr. Taylor" who fan that mistrust.

**Update**

Dale McGowan has quite properly (and gently) chastised me for implying that he didn't know about NCSE.  See [this comment](http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=4504#comment-4594) on his post.
