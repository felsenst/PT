I have not seen this in the New York Times yet, so I guess it is not Real News, but evidently [Richard Dawkins (or the Richard Dawkins Foundation) is suing his webmaster for alleged embezzlement](http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/10/22/31283.htm). Dawkins alleges that the webmaster, Josh Timonen, embezzled nearly $400,000, which appears to be most of the money earned by an on-line store that Timonen operated on behalf of the foundation. Timonen has posted a reply [here](http://joshtimonen.com/post/1387207318/the-ultimate-betrayal). I also noticed a [discussion](http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=189474) at the James Randi Educational Foundation and a short [article](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/rdf_v_timonen.php) on Pharyngula.  The question of who owns certain intellectual property promises to have very interesting consequences.  All I know. Thanks to Abigail Smith for the tip.
