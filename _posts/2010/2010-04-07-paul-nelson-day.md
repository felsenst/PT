A few days ago [I teased another upcoming ID anniversary](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/04/an-id-anniversa.html). It's Paul Nelson Day, the anniversary of Nelson's so far unfulfilled  promise to provide a detailed exposition of "ontogenetic depth."  [PZ has the details on Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/happy_monkey_paul_nelson_its_b.php).

Added in edit: [John Lynch also notes the anniversary](http://blog.jmlynch.org/2010/04/07/happy-paul-nelson-day/), and points out that Nelson [is aware of it](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/04/a_puzzle_on_the_eve_of_paul_ne.html).  Nelson also provides the toy model that he thinks shows that developmental biologists are incapable of accounting for cell differentiation.  Nelson's misconception is encapsulated in this sentence:

> We need to know the minimal instruction (or command) set, which must be present in the starting cell, for this to happen reliably.
