The Smithsonian Institution has launched a [new web site](http://humanorigins.si.edu/) focused on human origins.  It includes a good deal of material on [the evidence](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence) (behavior, fossils, genetics, and dating) and [Smithsonian's research projects](http://humanorigins.si.edu/research), along with what looks like a very useful set of [education resources](http://humanorigins.si.edu/education) including lesson plans for teachers, a teachers forum, and student resources including an interactive [mystery skull interactive exercise](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/mystery-skull-interactive) (I had trouble with that in Chrome but not in Firefox; apparently there's a Flash glitch in the interaction of the site with Chrome).

And just to stir the pot a little, the page on the [Broader Social Impacts Committee](http://humanorigins.si.edu/about/bsic) will provide some fuel to the accommodationist/hardliner feud.  In particular, notice who is _not_ represented on it.

At any rate, I strongly commend the site to your attention.
