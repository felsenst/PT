By now everyone has heard how the pro-terrorism group [Revolution Muslim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Muslim) threatened South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker [by stating "they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh," posting a picture of the murdered film director, and helpfully including their addresses at South Park studios, and the address of Comedy Central's offices](http://revolutionmuslim.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4384:south-park-to-air-episode-with-cartoon-of-the-prophet-muhammad-saaws&amp;catid=52:abu-talhah-al-amrikee&amp;Itemid=95).  The threat was issued after South Park's episode "200" in which all the people that South Park ever made fun of, led by Tom Cruise, teamed up to get back at the town.  To protect themselves from the ridicule of South Park citizens, they plotted to capture Muhammad and steal his secret ability to not be made fun of.  To avoid breaking the rule against depicting the prophet Muhammad, Stone & Parker dressed Muhammad up in a bear suit. 

(Never mind that Muhammad had co-starred sans censorship in the 2001 episode "Super-Best Friends", since played as a rerun hundreds of times without controversy, and that Muhammad appeared hundreds of more times amongst the other Super-Best Friends in post-2001 intro graphics for the show.)

After the threat was issued, and after Comedy Central began to kowtow to the terrorists by increasing the censorship of the show, the sequel episode "201" revealed that it had not been Muhammad in a bear suit after all, but Santa Claus.  Despite the complete non-depiction of Muhammad in the show (in the non-bear-costume shots, Muhammad had been hidden behind a CENSORED box), Comedy Central has now taken even the censored version of episode 201, and the old Super-Best Friends episode, off its website.

Anyway, what's the connection to evolution?  Well, I was watching a CNN discussion which featured a clip scrolling through RevolutionMuslim.com's blogposts.  Here's the cowardly "kill people who disagree" (I'm paraphrasing, obviously) post...

...and, guess what [the very next post](http://revolutionmuslim.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4513:evolution-fact-or-fiction&amp;catid=69:abu-juhayman&amp;Itemid=100) is?  That's right...

I'll quote the evolution post in full for historical archiving purposes (italics original)...

Googling shows that the text is identical to [this text posted March 23](http://www.supportersofsunnah.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=19:evolution-fact-or-fiction?&amp;Itemid=7) on another Islamic website.  And the claims are presumably taken straight from Harun Yahya materials, which are known for an extra-strong fixation on the idea that the fossil record shows no evidence of change (and [for confusing fishing lures with the real insect](http://sciencereligionnews.blogspot.com/2009/02/evolution-of-harun-yahyas-atlas-of.html)).  And of course the Stephen Meyer DNA/information argument, the Fred Hoyle Boeing 747 argument, etc., have been copied by the Muslim creationists from the Christian ID/creationist movement.

Anyway, it's utterly standard antievolution silliness.  I wouldn't draw any particular guilt-by-association conclusions about Christian fundamentalist creationism/ID from this -- after all, no one can control what kooks will take up one's ideas.  But I do find it entertaining to ponder what RevolutionMuslim would think if it knew the agenda and political associations of the folks who manufactured the antievolution arguments they use, and vice versa.
