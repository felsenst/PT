Looks like the subpoena carpet bombing may have had an effect.  By agreement among all parties, _Freshwater v. Mount Vernon Board of Education, et al._ [has been dismissed](http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1449).  The filing reads in its entirely

> Now come all parties, by and through counsel, to stipulate that John and Nancy Freshwater dismiss all claims contained in the first Amended Complaint with prejudice pursuant to Civ.R. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii).

.  I have no details yet.

Several commenters have noted this in [the earlier thread](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/10/freshwater-the-5.html#comment-236026); I was working Humane Society Bingo and couldn't post until now.
