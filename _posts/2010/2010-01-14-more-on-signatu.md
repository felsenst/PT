Yesterday, I [showed how the treatment of information](http://recursed.blogspot.com/2009/10/stephen-meyers-bogus-information-theory.html) in Stephen Meyer's book, _Signature in the Cell_, contains many misunderstandings and unjustified claims.

Today, I want to focus on what I call the "dishonesty factor" of the book:  claims that are misleading or just plain false.  The philosopher Thomas Nagel has [stated that](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/signature-in-the-cell-meyer-responds-in-the-tls/) "Meyer's book seems to me to be written in good faith."  Perhaps, after reading these examples, he might reconsider his assessment.
