<big>[Fraser River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_River), an endangered river environment, Pitt Meadows, B. C., Canada.</big>  Mr. Lord writes, "In 2010, the Fraser River became the third most endangered river in British Columbia due to pollution, agriculture, industrialization, and urbanization.   In the 18 years in which the list of endangered rivers of B. C. has been kept,  the Fraser River has been in the top 5, 17 times.   The Fraser river is home to the endangered white sturgeon.  In 2009,  90% of the expected return of spawning sockeye salmon did not show up in the Fraser River.  A catastrophic collapse of the sockeye salmon population may have occurred, possibly due to overfishing, pollution, and climate change."
