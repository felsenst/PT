Two years ago, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal signed the Louisiana Science Education Act (LSEA) into law, as [noted on The Panda's Thumb](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/06/bad-news-la-jin.html).

When the law was being considered in the Legislature, its proponents were adamant that it wasn't about "creationism" or "intelligent design."  Folks from the Louisiana Family Forum and the Discovery Institute backed the LSEA, of course, but all they were interested in was good critical thinking, right?

Well, not so much.  Now the Livingston Parish School Board is openly using the LSEA as legal justification to implement the teaching of creationism in their public schools.  Barbara Forrest, one of the expert witnesses in Kitzmiller v. Dover exposes the maneuverings and alliances of anti-evolution forces in here state in [a post at the Louisiana Coalition for Science](http://lasciencecoalition.org/2010/07/29/livingston-parish-and-discover-institute-law/).

Predictably, the Discovery Institute is now doing the same thing it did back in 2005 to the Dover School Board.  They're turning on their own supporters, and asking [how anyone could possibly confuse their ideas with creationism](http://spectator.org/archives/2010/08/04/a-classic-evolution-policy-blu ).  In this American Spectator article, Bruce Chapman, President of the Discovery Institute, now states that the very people who supported his efforts to get the LSEA passed are "ignorant" of the content of intelligent design theory.  Darn.  I wonder how those poor folks managed to think that ID equals creationism?

Somehow, the more things change, the more they remain the same.  Could it be that the next Kitzmiller Reunion will be in Louisiana?
