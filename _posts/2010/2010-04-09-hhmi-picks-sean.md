The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) [selected evolutionary biologist Sean Carroll](http://www.hhmi.org/news/carrollvp20100407.html) to serve as its vice president for science education. Carroll replaces Peter J. Bruns, who is retiring after serving nine years in that role at HHMI. Carroll is a researcher in evolutionary consequences of developmental processes, or "evo-devo", and a noted science writer. HHMI is a significant supporter of science education, having invested over $1.6 billion dollars in science education programs over the years.

We congratulate both Carroll and HHMI, and hope this new collaboration does great things.
