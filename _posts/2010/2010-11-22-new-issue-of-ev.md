T. Ryan Gregory [flags the availability](http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2010/11/evolution-education-and-outreach-volume-3-number-4/) of the newest issue of "Evolution: Education and Outreach" a few days ago.  The main emphasis is on 'tree thinking' and there are some very good resources available there.  However, of interest to me was [Mazur's article](http://springerlink.com/content/10368n434r248403/) on the relationship of religiosity, political conservatism, education, and acceptance of several scientific propositions about evolution, plate tectonics, the Big Bang, and heliocentrism.
