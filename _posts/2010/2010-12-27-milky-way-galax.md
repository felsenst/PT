<big>[Milky Way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) rising, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Minnesota.</big> Mr. Stodola writes, "For this picture it's the darkness of the night sky, essential to taking a picture like this, that I'm calling endangered.  There appears to be no location in my entire state with night skies as dark as I was able to get in the BWCA, and even at that I could still see some light pollution on the horizon.  The nearest location with similarly dark skies may be about 250 miles away from where I live."
