The Austin American-Statesman [ reports](http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2010/03/03/thomas_ratliff_upset_state_boa.html) that Thomas Ratliff has narrowly defeated Don McLeroy in the Republican primary race for Texas State Board of Education. McLeroy is the right-wing extremist who wants to doctor the state science standards so they reflect his own disbelief in the theory of evolution. Since there is no Democratic candidate, Ratliff will automatically assume McLeroy's seat.

The Dallas Morning News [reports](http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/local/stories/030210dnpoledboard.3a15ed5.html) that Ratliff had received the support of "mainstream public education groups" and quotes him as saying, "I want to take politics out of our public schools," and added that Ratliff

> told gatherings across the district that Texans are tired of political posturing on the board as the social conservative \[sic\] bloc -- led by McLeroy -- tries to impose its views in history, science and other areas of the curriculum.
> 
> "Our kids don't go to red schools. They don't go to blue schools. They go to local schools," he said, also criticizing attempts by some board members to inject their religious beliefs into what children are taught. 

The News reports further that McLeroy was "unapologetic about the actions of the social conservatives" and bragged about the "incredible accomplishments that will help our children."

Thanks to a commenter known to me only as Aagcobb for the tip.
