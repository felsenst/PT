Nick Matzke has just directed my attention to this [minor trove](http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/cgi/b/bib/bib-idx?type=simple&amp;c=vvs-bib&amp;sid=&amp;q1=evolution&amp;rgn1=entire+record&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) of sheet music and other documents relating to the Scopes trial.  The song, "Don't Make a Monkey out of Me," begins with these words:

>  Now the air is full of language\[,\] it surely is a sight,
> 
> \[W\]hat is this evolution and is it wrong or right?
> 
> They say we sprang from monkeys, why blame it on the monk,
> 
> But lots of folks will hope that this is just a lot of bunk\[.\] 

There are 3 choruses, the first of which goes,

> Please don't make a monkey out of me,
> 
> I never had that kind of pedigree
> 
> Mister Darwin may be right and daddy's tale was long
> 
> But way down South in Tennessee they think he's dead wrong\[.\]

My wife scanned a few pages of the sheet music and declared it, to coin a phrase, not even trite.

Other songs include "The Isle of Illusia," "The Missing Link," "I Hope the Monkey's \[sic\] Win," and "The Evolutin Riddle, Dedicated to the Evoluted Monkeys." The last begins like this:

> That Evolutin Statesman made a monkey out of me,
> 
> With scientific wisdom he has found my pedigree,
> 
> With a theorizing mind he has traced my family tree,
> 
> And tells me when I lost my tail and left me as you see.

Plus Ã§a change, ....

Richard Hoppe further directs us to [Monkey Business](http://tinyurl.com/6khh3k ), and [Monkey Doodle Doo](http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/irving_berlin/the_monkey_doodle_doo.html), the latter by Irving Berlin in 1913.  These are no less amusing, but neither is particularly anti-evolution in its outlook. Indeed, the Irving Berlin song clearly recognizes the power of evolution:

> Go, my little dearie, there's the Darwin theory
> 
> Telling me and you
> 
> To do the Monkey Doodle Doo
