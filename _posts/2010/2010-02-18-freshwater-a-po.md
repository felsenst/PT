Me on the [A Pair of Continents podcast](http://www.thebigcigarette.com/The_Big_Cigarette/The_Big_Podcast/The_Big_Podcast.html) talking about the Freshwater affair.  The interview starts around 17:00 of Episode 39.  Fat Steve and Dany are fun and interesting folks and I recommend their other podcasts, especially the two featuring PZ Myers ("Easy PZ" to Dany; episode 36) and Richard Wiseman (Episode 20).  Well, actually, they're the only two I've listened to so far and I hope to get to their interviews with John Horgan and Skepchick Rebecca Watson soon.  But again, highly recommended.  After all, they interviewed me!  :)
