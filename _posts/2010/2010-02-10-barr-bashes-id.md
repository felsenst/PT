Writing in the journal _First Things_, University of Delaware physicist Stephen Barr [offers some frank words](http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2010/02/the-end-of-intelligent-design) for the ID movement:

> It is time to take stock: What has the intelligent design movement achieved? As science, nothing. The goal of science is to increase our understanding of the natural world, and there is not a single phenomenon that we understand better today or are likely to understand better in the future through the efforts of ID theorists. If we are to look for ID achievements, then, it must be in the realm of natural theology. And there, I think, the movement must be judged not only a failure, but a debacle.

Goodness!  And that's just the first paragraph.

It is hard not to like an essay that begins like _that_, and I certainly agree with his general assessment of the ID movement.  This criticism is all the more significant for appearing in a religious venue by a writer who is himself religious.  (Barr is the author of the book _Modern Physics and Ancient Faith_).  Still, I found much to criticize in some of the specific arguments Barr offers.  The details can be found [in this post](http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2010/02/barr_bashes_id.php) over at EvolutionBlog.  Comments can be left there.
