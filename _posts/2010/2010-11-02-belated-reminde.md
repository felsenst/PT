In addition to the [Columbus Science Pub](http://www.facebook.com/ColumbusSciencePub) (link is to its Facebook page) previously pimped here, there's the [Columbus Science Cafe](http://go.osu.edu/osusciencecafe).  This week--in fact tomorrow, Wednesday, Nov 3, at 6:30 pm--Jeff McKee will speak on "The Far Side of Evolution" using (among other things) [Gary Larson's cartoons](http://www.thefarside.com/) as illustrations.

Jeff is a physical anthropologist in the Department of Anthropology & Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology at The Ohio State University, a former excavator (IIRC) at [Sterkfontein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterkfontein), a stalwart of [Ohio Citizens for Science](http://www.ohioscience.org/), and general all-around good guy.  The Cafe is at [Gateway Film Center](http://gatewayfilmcenter.com/parking-direction) at 1550 North High Street.
