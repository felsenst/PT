Todd Wood, a young earth creationist at Bryan College, [provides summary data](http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2010/05/creationist-finances-revisited.html) on YEC organizations' finances over the 2003-2008 period.  There are several interesting things about those data.

First, as Wood points out, AIG's share of the creationist dollar grew over that period, from 61.6% ($9M) of the market in 2003 to 68.2% ($22.7M) in 2008.  AIG's growth in market share came at the expense of all the other YEC organizations, with the [Institute for Creation Research](http://www.icr.org/) (ICR) and and the [Creation Research Society](http://www.creationresearch.org/) (CRS), the two elder U.S. creationist organizations, contributing most of the change.  While ICR's revenues also increased over those years, from $4,5M to $8.7M, as a percentage of the total creationist dollar it decreased from 30.6% to 26.2% and CRS's percentage declined from 1.7% to 1.0% as its dollar revenues declined from $250K to $230K.  The smaller YEC organizations also lost share.

Second, Eric Hovind, offspring of jailed tax evader Kent Hovind, entered the list in third place in 2008 with his "GodQuest" (DBA Creation Science Evangelism) at $930K for 2.8% of the creationism market, far behind ICR's $8.7M but well ahead of CRS's $230K.

Third (and pretty depressing to see), [NCSE's](http://ncse.com/) gross revenue as a percentage of AIG's gross revenue has steadily declined over those years, dropping from 7.8% in 2003 to just 5.7% in 2008.  In 2008, 85% of NCSE's revenues ($1.1M of $1.3M) came from direct public support--memberships and donations from you and me.  While the amount has increased in absolute terms over those years, as a proportion of creationist revenues it has dropped significantly.  C'mon, people.  Let's put our money where our mouths are.

_Hat tip to [Wood](http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2010/05/creationist-finances-revisited.html) for doing the digging in form 990s._
