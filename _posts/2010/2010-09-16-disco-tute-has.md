[Josh Rosenau notes](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2010/09/disco_rubs_out_new_writers_min.php) that the Disco 'Tute's house organ, _Evolution News and Views_, has a new contributor, [Heather ~~Sieger~~ Zieger](http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4324659/), currently a research associate at [Probe Ministries](http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4213839/k.AF17/Probe_Ministries.htm), a fundamentalist ministry, one of whose co-founders is Jon Buell, publisher of "Of Pandas and People" of "cdesign proponentsists" fame.  And there's a nice wrinkle: The Disco 'Tute's description of her completely neglects her four years of apologetics work at Probe Ministries.  But it's all about the science, right?
