Every Saturday on the square in downtown Madison you can find a big box covered with tired, ridiculous claims of Young Earth Creationism. Standing nearby Larry and Kevin preach the Gospel of Jesus-On-A-Triceratops to the curious and appalled alike. Together they make sort of a "good cop, bad cop" of creationism: Kevin, sort of a naive and basically likeable innocent guy, and Larry, a blustering, know-it-all whose abysmal knowledge of science is only inversely matched by his inflated sense of how much he thinks he knows. With creationists like these, who needs evolutionists.

Read a[ description of my encounters with them](http://sevans.venomouspenguin.com/creo) over a few weekends this summer on another server, and post your comments here at Panda's Thumb.
