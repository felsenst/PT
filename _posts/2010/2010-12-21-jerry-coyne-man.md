[Jerry Coyne reports](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/21/new-genes-arise-quickly/) on [a new paper in _Science_ by Manyuan Long and colleagues](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6011/1682.full) on the origin and history of new genes in a large group of _Drosophila_ that have recently had their full genomes sequenced.  

Having this much phylogenetic and genomic information allows researchers to estimate the phylogenetic position of the origin of a new gene (566 new genes amongst the group of 12 fully sequenced genomes, actually), and the periods of time in which directional selection, stabilizing selection, or drift were the dominant regime that the new genes were evolving under. In many cases, there is a period of high selection after the origin of the gene, which weakens later -- which is just what you would expect if the well-known, standard model for the origin of new genes is correct.

Two additional points are worth mentioning: (1) in some cases (about 30%, 59 out of the 195 they targeted for knockout studies), these new genes have become essential to viability for the species in question -- even though they are totally absent in other, basically similar, flies that do just fine without them!  This is strong support for the notion  that one way "irreducible" systems evolve is by evolving parts that are helpful at first, but later become essential as other parts coadapt to become dependent on them.  (2) I'm sure Luskin, Ewert, and other DI people would like to dismiss this as just another case of evolutionists "illegitimately" inferring common ancestry from "mere" sequence similarity, and that "common design" could be the explanation.  However, in any other context, these creationists, and virtually any creationists including the young-earthers, would easily say that all of these _Drosophila_ are just different varieties of the _Drosophila_ kind, and that whatever variety exists between them (minor, in the grand scheme of biology) is "merely" "microevolution within the kind!"  (And in the _Edge of Evolution_, Behe clearly puts his estimated "edge" well above the genus level.)

What's that?  Standard boring microevolutionary processes can produce new genes with modified sequences and new functions, which is clearly new information on anyone's definition, even the creationists' and even (explicitly so) Michael Behe's definition?  Oh my goodness, someone better call the DI news blog to put out this fire and reassure the faithful!
