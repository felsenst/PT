The anniversary of some specific predictions by IDist William Dembski has arrived, and Kristine, the [Amused Muse](http://amused-muse.blogspot.com/), has [reminded us](http://amused-muse.blogspot.com/2010/04/evolution-boffo-boo-id-floppo-poo.html) that Dembski predicted in 2006 that within 10 years the theory of evolution will be dead.  We're four years on from that prediction and nothing I see tends to confirm it.  Anyone else?

The original news article isn't available on the web any more, but both Kristine and [Ed Brayton](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/04/dembski_as_prophet.php) have sufficient extracts from it to reconstruct Dembski's hubristic pronouncements.  Brayton also supplies a link to Glenn Morton's invaluable collection of quotations on [The Imminent Demise of Evolution](http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm).  Dembski is a minor figure in a long line of failed prophets.

By the way, another ID anniversary is nearly upon us.  Any guesses as to what it is?
