_Creation_, the true story of Charles Darwin, based on the book by Randal Keynes, Darwin's great-great-grandson, opens in theaters this Friday in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, and D.C.

"His love for his wife, his observations of his children, his friendships with gardeners, schoolteachers and pigeon fanciers, his fears about death, revolution, bankruptcy, inbreeding . . . all these things found their way into his theory. He was the most inclusive of thinkers." Randal Keynes, _Annie's Box_
