The photographer, Tom Harnish, writes that _Zantedeschia_ is often misnamed [_Calla_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calla):  "_Zantedeschia_ is a different genus than _Calla_ -- not a small distinction if you consider that dogs and cats are two different genera (_Canidae_ and _Felidae_). Imagine going into a pet store and seeing signs over the puppies that indicate they're cats? Oddly, most garden shops label these flowers calla (even cala) lilies, and that's what most people call them. _Zantedeschia_, shown here, are from tropical Africa, and should not be confused with the smaller white calla that grows in bogs of northern Europe, Asia, and North America."
