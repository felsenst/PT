Last summer, I began working as a postdoc at the University of Houston.  I was initially unsure about the move, but I am pleasantly surprised with the city and the university.  There is a strong, core group in ecology and evolutionary biology here.  Thus I pass on this student recruitment letter, with the mention that if you attend school here, you will get to hang out with Prof. Steve Steve.
