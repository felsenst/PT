Intelligent Design Creationism has evolved yet again.  In preparing for a discussion last month (May) with Charles Thaxton I went to [the DI's site](http://www.intelligentdesign.org/) to see what their definition of ID was.  What I found was this:

> Intelligent design is a scientific theory which holds that certain features of the universe and living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, and are not the result of an undirected, chance-based process such as Darwinian evolution.

OK so what does the same site say today, a month later?

> Intelligent design refers to a scientific research program as well as a community of scientists, philosophers and other scholars who seek evidence of design in nature. The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.

Notice the two important differences?  1) Apparently ID is no longer a "scientific theory" instead it now refers to "a scientific research program"  and 2) ID is no longer contrasted with "chance-based process such as Darwinian evolution." but rather is now compared to "an undirected process such as natural selection."

It makes one wonder whether this is simply the natural evolution of ID as it continually adapts to an ever changing environment or whether recent court defeats, rejections by state school boards, and continued lack of intellectual advancement have brought about their own form of punctuated equilibria for intelligent design.
