Casey Luskin is [blathering about](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/03/smithsonians_new_human_origins.html) the new Smithsonian [exhibit on human origins](http://humanorigins.si.edu/), playing the hoary old creationist 'gaps in the fossil record' tune.  He must have been reading Duane Gish again.  James Kidder has [a nice takedown](http://scienceandcreation.blogspot.com/2010/04/casey-luskin-on-smithsonian-human.html).  Recommended reading.
