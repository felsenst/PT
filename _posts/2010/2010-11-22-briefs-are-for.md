Y'all remember how, years ago, [Casey Luskin and the boys were calling Judge Jones a plagiarist](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/dis-plagiarism.html) because the final decision in _Kitzmiller_drew a lot of language from the briefs? I pointed out at the time that, well, that's what briefs are for. Now [here's an article in _Political Research Quarterly_](http://prq.sagepub.com/content/early/2007/10/06/1065912907306474.short)that uses software to find that even the U.S. Supreme Court draws a lot of language from the briefs filed by the parties in any particular case, thus reaching the unremarkable conclusion that "there is a connection between the language of the parties' briefs and the language of the opinions, which means that parties have the potential to influence the law." For most of us, it's nice to know that court opinions show the judges actually read the briefs. But for Luskin & Co., it's doubtless evidence of just how huge the ~~Darwinist~~ plagiarist conspiracy really is.
