The Institute for Creation Research has apparently closed its graduate school after being denied the authority to offer a master's degree in science education. See the [concession](http://www.icr.org/article/5527/) by Henry Morris III.  The  National Center for Science Education [reports](http://ncse.com/news/2010/09/icr-not-out-woods-yet-006161), however, that the ICR is opening instead a School of Biblical Apologetics, which will offer a master's degree in Christian education, as well as a minor in creation research.  The graduate school may be exempt from licensing requirements as long as it offers purely religious degrees.

[NCSE](http://ncse.com) has provided the following links for anyone who wants to investigate further:

NCSE's [collection of documents](http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/institute-creation-research-graduate-school-v-paredes-et-al) from the case. 

The [court's ruling](http://ncse.com/webfm_send/1380), which denied ICR's appeal.

An [article](http://nwcreation.net/articles/Is_there_a_future.pdf) on the School of Biblical Apologetics. 

ICR's [explanation](http://www.icr.org/soba/faq/#q11) of its exempt status.
