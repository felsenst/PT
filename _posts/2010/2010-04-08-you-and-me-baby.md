The song of the title of this post is a [catchy and highly amusing piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fqncj3G6tg&amp;feature=related) that suggests that if we're just mammals we should have sex. It's sort of a low brow version of Andrew Marvell's _To his coy mistress_. Instead of Time's wingÃ©d chariot, we should do what mammals do on the Discovery Channel. Except, humans don't. They do something _special_. Think about it. We aren't dogs, monkeys, dolphins or bowerbirds, we're _humans_. We are a _species_ (which, as I keep reminding folk, is the noun of "special").

So when Phillip Johnson, the father of the modern intelligent design movement, [attacks](http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=23-02-009-c) Christopher Hitchens for calling "great men" "mammals", and points out:

> While Hitchens never refers to the authorities on his side as "mammals," reserving that category for those whom he wishes to belittle, it will not escape the reader that if "great men" are only mammals, then so are scientists, including the esteemed Charles Darwin and the not-quite-so-esteemed Richard Dawkins, and so, of course, is Hitchens himself. Which raises the question: Why should we take seriously any speculation by a mere mammal, or even the consensus of mammal opinion, about the origin of its species, no matter how much evidence the mammals imagine themselves to have gathered?

... we might be inclined to agree. If we're just mammals, then we shouldn't pay attention to Hitchens or Dawkins or Darwin, right?

I call this Darwin's Monkey Mind Puzzle. Darwin wrote near the end of his life:

> But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trustworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind? \[Letter to William Graham, 1881\]

It is recently the argument presented by Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga against evolutionary theory - it's self defeating. If evolution is true, then we have no warrant for thinking that evolution is true, ergo Augustine is right. Or something. I would like to discuss this a little, reprising some arguments Paul Griffiths and I have presented in a forthcoming paper.
