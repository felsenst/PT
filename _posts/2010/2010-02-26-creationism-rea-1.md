We often argue that saying that "God did it" is a science stopper.  That claim is typically countered by pointing to numerous examples of scientists who were (Newton) or are (Kenneth Miller) Christians (though as we know, Newton was a peculiar sort of Christian, even for his time).

The Disco 'Tute, of course, doesn't think that positing an Intelligent Designer is a science-stopper.  Their 'solution,' embodied in the [Wedge strategy](http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html), is to redefine science to include ~~God~~ an unnamed intelligent designer with inscrutable goals and skills as an "explanation."

One variety of Christian "science," however, is clearly willing to stop science in its tracks, and [Todd C. Wood](http://www.bryan.edu/wood.html), faculty member at Bryan College, has provided a stark illustration of that.  While Wood has shocked his creationist peers on occasion, for example [for saying that](http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2009/09/truth-about-evolution.html)

> Evolution is **not** a theory in crisis. It is **not** teetering on the verge of collapse. It has **not** failed as a scientific explanation. There **is** evidence for evolution, gobs and gobs of it. It is **not** just speculation or a faith choice or an assumption or a religion. It **is** a productive framework for lots of biological research, and it has amazing explanatory power. There is **no** conspiracy to hide the truth about the failure of evolution. There has really been **no** failure of evolution as a scientific theory. It works, and it works well.  (All bolding original)

However, Wood has clear boundaries.  [Writing on his blog](http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2010/02/is-design-inference.html) more recently Wood says

> That's why I don't care about the origin of life (and why I'll probably never finish reading Meyer's book). I already know where life came from. I open the book of Genesis, and the Bible tells me exactly where life came from. Speculating on how it might have happened in a naturalistic scenario seems like a waste of time to me. Just like it would seem like a waste of time to an atheist to study the logistics of Noah's Ark.

Can't get any clearer than that.
