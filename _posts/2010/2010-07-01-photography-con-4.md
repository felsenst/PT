The second PT photography contest is accepting entries now through July 15.  Please read and follow the rules [here](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/06/photography-con-2.html) and pay particular attention to Rule 12.

Update, July 8:  Just to clarify, we give _preference_ to photographs of endangered species, but general entries are welcome as well.  If we receive enough endangered species, we will establish a separate category. Entries in the animal, mineral, and vegetable categories are also welcome.

**Update, July 15**: The deadline for submissions is _tonight_ at 10:00 Mountain Daylight Time.  MDT is UTC(GMT) - 6 h.
