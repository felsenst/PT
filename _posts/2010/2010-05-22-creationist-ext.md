I think sometimes academics and bloggers who oppose creationists don't really fully get the cultural and emotional context that the creationists are living in.  [You need to watch this May 20th episode of TBN's "Praise the Lord"](http://www.tbn.org/watch/files/index.php?file=2010_5_20_300k.wmv&amp;show=85), devoted to creationism.  Featured interviewees include Sean McDowell (son of Josh), Eric Hovind (son of Kent), Hugh Ross, Ray Comfort...and well-known non-creationist, Stephen Meyer.  But the first 15 minutes of the show gives you some idea of just how far this is from being an academic issue.
