Apparently Behe has been mentioning this in his England tour:

> Maarten Boudry, Stefaan Blancke, and Johan Braeckman

The [Boudry article is online here](http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence) and is quite good, catching points that most commentators on the IC argument miss. (Part of the goodness is that it [cites Pete Dunkleberg's 2003 "IC Demystified" at talkdesign.org](http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html), which is one of the better discussions out there.)

If past experience is any guide, Behe's article will make abstract arguments about the improbability of adaptations \*if\* many simultaneous events are required, but will present no evidence that many simultaneous events are likely to be necessary for the sorts of adaptations we actually see in biology.  Positive evidence for ID will not be provided at all, but the article will be trumpeted as such by the usual ID propagandists.  But the article isn't out yet, so we'll see, I suppose.
